   Genre(s) First-person shooter
   Mode(s) Single-player, multiplayer

   Call of Duty is a 2003 first-person shooter game developed by Infinity
   Ward and published by Activision. It is the first installment in the
   Call of Duty franchise,^[3] released on October 29, 2003, for Microsoft
   Windows. The game simulates infantry and combined arms warfare of World
   War II using a modified version of the id Tech 3 engine. Much of its
   theme and gameplay is similar to the Medal of Honor series; however,
   Call of Duty showcases multiple viewpoints staged in the American,
   British, and Soviet theaters of World War II.

   The game introduced a new take on AI-controlled allies who support the
   player during missions and react to situational changes during
   gameplay. This led to a greater emphasis on squad-based play as opposed
   to the "lone wolf" approach often portrayed in earlier first-person
   shooter games. Much of Infinity Ward's development team consisted of
   members who helped develop Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. The game
   received critical acclaim and won several Game of the Year awards from
   reviewers.

   In September 2004, an expansion pack called Call of Duty: United
   Offensive, which was produced by Activision and developed by Gray
   Matter Studios and Pi Studios, was released. At the same time the
   N-Gage Version got an Arena Pack with 3 new Levels.^[4] An enhanced
   port of Call of Duty for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, titled Call of
   Duty: Classic, developed by Aspyr, was released worldwide in November
   2009 with the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, being
   available via redemption codes included with the "Hardened" and
   "Prestige" editions of the game.^[5]

Gameplay[edit]

   [210px-CallDuty1PC.jpg] In-game screenshot of Call of Duty on PC

   As a first-person shooter, Call of Duty places the player in control of
   an infantry soldier who makes use of various authentic World War II
   firearms in combat. Each mission features a series of objectives that
   are marked on the heads-up display's compass; the player must complete
   all objectives to advance to the next mission. The player can save and
   load at any time, rather than the checkpoint system utilized in later
   Call of Duty games.

   The player has two primary weapon slots, a handgun slot, and can carry
   up to ten grenades. Weapons may be exchanged with those found on the
   battlefield dropped by dead soldiers. Unlike later Call of Duty games,
   the first allows the player to toggle between different firing modes
   (single shot or automatic fire). Call of Duty was one of the early
   first-person shooters to feature iron sights in game play; by pressing
   the corresponding key the player aims down the gun's actual sights for
   increased accuracy. In addition to weapons carried by the player,
   mounted machine guns and other fixed weapon emplacements are
   controllable by the player.

   The game uses a standard health points system, with a limited amount of
   health reflected by a health bar. Medkits scattered throughout the
   levels or dropped by some foes are used to restore health when the
   player is injured.

   Call of Duty also featured "shellshock" (not to be confused with the
   psychological condition of the same name): when there is an explosion
   near the player, he momentarily experiences simulated tinnitus,
   appropriate sound "muffling" effects, blurred vision, and also results
   in the player slowing down, unable to sprint.

   As the focus of the game is on simulation of the actual battlefield,
   the gameplay differed from many single-player shooters of the time. The
   player moves in conjunction with allied soldiers rather than alone;
   allied soldiers will assist the player in defeating enemy soldiers and
   advancing; however, the player is given charge of completing certain
   objectives. The game places heavy emphasis on usage of cover,
   suppressive fire, and grenades. AI-controlled soldiers will take cover
   behind walls, barricades, and other obstacles when available.

Campaign[edit]

  American campaign[edit]

   The American campaign begins in August 1942 with Private Martin, a
   newly enlisted member of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment,
   completing basic training at Camp Toccoa. In June 1944, Martin
   establishes a landing zone for soldiers participating in Operation
   Overlord. The paratroopers are scattered, leaving Martin in a mixed
   unit formed from various companies led by his CO Cpt. Foley, who seize
   a nearby town from Germans. Martin and his unit are sent to force the
   remaining Germans from Sainte-Mère-Église and disable several
   Flakpanzers (anti-aircraft tanks) as D-Day begins. Martin's unit
   destroys German artillery positions attacking the landing force at Utah
   Beach. Afterwards, Martin learns that his unit has been assigned to
   participate in an attack on a Bavarian manor to rescue two British
   officers, Captain Price and Major Ingram. He learns from Price that
   Ingram had already been moved to a more secure POW camp for
   interrogation; Martin and Price infiltrate the camp and rescue Ingram.
   Martin's unit later takes part in the Battle of the Bulge, successfully
   securing top-secret documents and stopping an attempt by the Germans to
   call in tanks.

  British campaign[edit]

   The British campaign starts with Sergeant Jack Evans and a unit from
   2nd Ox and Bucks of the 6th Airborne Division taking part in Operation
   Tonga. The unit is dropped in Horsa gliders near Pegasus Bridge,
   Bénouville. Led by Captain Price, Evans and his troops clear the bridge
   of German soldiers. The unit holds out against an attempt by a German
   battalion to retake the bridge with the help of the 7th Parachute
   Battalion.

   By September, Evans has been transferred to the SAS. He takes part in a
   mission to sabotage the Eder Dam, restored after being destroyed by the
   No. 617 Squadron RAF during Operation Chastise, destroying the
   anti-aircraft guns protecting it. Following extraction, Evans helps to
   cut off pursuing German troops. Reaching a German airport to escape,
   Evans uses an anti-air gun to cover Price and Waters from German Stuka
   dive-bombers as they procure and flee in a Fw.200. Evans and Price then
   pose as German naval officers and sailors to infiltrate the battleship
   Tirpitz, disable its defenses, and steals information for the RAF to
   attack the ship. Price sacrifices himself to buy time for Evans, who
   escapes with Waters by boat. Later, Evans, Waters and their squad
   arrive near Burgsteinfurt, Germany, to assist the impending Allied
   assault on the city. Discovering plans to launch V-2 rockets at the
   Allied forces, the unit destroys them before joining the rest of the
   army.

  Soviet campaign[edit]

   The Soviet campaign begins during the Battle of Stalingrad in September
   1942. Corporal Alexei Ivanovich Voronin and his fellow recruits are
   sent across the Volga River, many of whom are killed when the Luftwaffe
   launch an attack. Once across, they call in an artillery strike that
   forces the Germans back. At Red Square with Soviet officers killing
   soldiers who retreat, Voronin kills several German officer and
   soldiers, disrupting the German offense long enough for Soviet
   artillery to destroy their tanks. Voronin links up with surviving
   allies in a train station and guides them to Major Zubov of the 13th
   Guards Rifle Division; Voronin is promoted to Junior Sergeant. In
   November, Voronin rendezvous with a unit led by Sergeant Pavlov, tasked
   with retaking an apartment building in German hands. The unit assaults
   and clears the building, and defends it from a German counterattack.

   In January 1945, Voronin, now a full Sergeant, serves with the 150th
   Rifle Division of the 3rd Shock Army. The unit secures a makeshift
   German tank repair facility in Warsaw during the Vistula–Oder
   Offensive, and regroup with the 4th Guards Tank Army. Due to shortages
   in experienced soldiers, Voronin commands a T-34-85 tank for the 2nd
   Guards Tank Army, and helps the Soviets capture a town near the Oder
   River. In April, Sergeant Voronin is returned to his old unit, the
   150th Rifle Division. He and a small group of soldiers storm the
   Reichstag building and raise the Victory Banner atop the roof, ending
   the European war.

Development[edit]

   [220px-E3_2003_%28343111642%29.jpg] Promotion at E3 2003

   Call of Duty was developed by Infinity Ward, a new studio formed in
   2002 originally consisting of 21 employees, many of whom were project
   lead developers of the successful Medal of Honor: Allied Assault
   released the same year. Led by Chief Creative Officer Vince Zampella,
   development began in April 2002, and the team grew to 27 members by May
   2003. At its beginning, the project was nicknamed "Medal of Honor
   Killer".^[6] Using an enhanced version of the id Tech 3 game engine
   developed for Quake III Arena and an in-house skeletal animation system
   called "Ares", Infinity Ward set out to develop a new World War II-era
   video game that, unlike many of its predecessors, placed more emphasis
   on squad-based play with intelligent assistance from teammates during
   large-scale battles. The team also extensively researched weapons,
   artillery, and vehicles from World War II to enhance the authenticity
   of animation and sounds used throughout the game.^[7] The game's budget
   was $4.5 million.^[8]

   Another area the development team focused on was their artificial
   intelligence (AI) pathfinding component dubbed "Conduit". The ability
   to suppress the enemy with cover fire and clear obstacles, such as
   fences and windows, was tightly integrated into the squad-based aspect
   of the single-player campaigns. The AI in the game was designed to
   flank the opponent, bank grenades, and move from one cover point to
   another.^[2] Lead animation director Michael Boon explained that
   actions which would have normally been scripted in past games were
   moved to a dynamic AI environment, in order to help create a different
   experience each time levels are replayed.^[9] While the campaigns were
   the primary focus, development of the multiplayer modes were tailored
   to please modders. Zied Rieke, a lead designer, clarified that gameplay
   and modes were written in script making it "extremely easy for players
   to make their own modifications to Call of Duty multiplayer".^[9]

  Critical reception[edit]

   Call of Duty received "critical acclaim", according to review
   aggregator Metacritic.^[10] It won several "Game of the Year" awards
   for 2003 from several reviewers.

   During the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the
   D.I.C.E. Awards), Call of Duty was honored "Game of the Year" of 2003
   by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences; it also won awards for
   "Computer Game of the Year" and "Computer First Person Action Game of
   the Year", along with nominations for "Outstanding Innovation in
   Computer Gaming", "Outstanding Achievement in Original Music
   Composition", and "Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design".^[16]

   GameSpot named it the best computer game of October 2003.^[17]

   Computer Games Magazine named Call of Duty the sixth-best computer game
   of 2003, and the editors wrote, "This game ups the ante in the WWII
   shooter arena, and makes everything that has come before it seem as
   outdated as France's army."^[18] The editors of Computer Gaming World
   presented Call of Duty with their 2003 "Shooter of the Year" award.
   They remarked, "Call of Duty won this category without a shot
   fired—there simply was no debate."^[19] It was also nominated for "Best
   Game" at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards. While it did not
   receive that award, it did win Infinity Ward the "Rookie Studio of the
   Year". Chuck Russom was also presented with the "Excellence in Audio"
   award for his work on the game.^[20]

   IGN rated the game 9.3/10, with reviewer Dan Adams saying "You have to
   love a game that glues you to your seat and keeps you interested... A
   thrilling piece of software that action fans should grab a hold of and
   love fiercely." His only negative critique was on the short length of
   the game, which many reviewers pointed out.^[21]

   The N-Gage version got "mixed or average reviews" on the site
   Metacritic.^[22]

  Sales[edit]

   The NPD Group named Call of Duty the eighth-best-selling computer game
   of 2003.^[23] It maintained this position on NPD's computer game sales
   rankings for the following year.^[24] In the United States alone, Call
   of Duty sold 790,000 copies and earned $29.6 million (~$41.5 million in
   2022) by August 2006. At the time, this led Edge to declare it the
   country's 13th-best-selling computer game released since January
   2000.^[25]

   In the United Kingdom, Call of Duty sold 95,000 copies by the end of
   2003, which made it 88th-biggest seller across all platforms that
   year.^[26] Discussing this performance, Kristan Reed of
   GamesIndustry.biz wrote that "Activision will be pleased that it
   managed to interrupt the Sims party" with the game's release.^[27] Call
   of Duty ultimately received a "Silver" sales award from the
   Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA),^[28]
   indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.^[29]

   Call of Duty ultimately sold 4.5 million copies worldwide by 2013.^[30]

Franchise[edit]
