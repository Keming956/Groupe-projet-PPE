Manner of acquisitions

   Examples of property acquisition in which ad valorem stamp duty (i.e.
   BSD, ABSD and SSD, whichever applicable) is payable:
    1. By way of purchase e.g. acceptance to option to purchase, sale and
       purchase agreement
    2. By way of gift including a voluntary declaration of trust and
       settlement
          + Declaration of Trust / Trust Deed:
               o A fixed duty of $10 is payable on the Declaration of
                 Trust/Trust deed which does not result in a change in
                 beneficial interest in the property.
               o Where there is a change in beneficial interest in the
                 property, ad valorem stamp duty will be payable on the
                 Declaration of Trust / Trust Deed.
    3. By way of distribution in specie upon the winding up of a company*
    4. By way of distribution from the estate of a deceased that is not in
       accordance to the Will, Intestate Succession Act or Muslim Law of
       Inheritance.
    5. By way of resulting trust pursuant to a renunciation of interest in
       residential property held under a bare trust

   *ABSD is applicable on transfer of interest in a residential property
   on or after 13 Oct 2023 which is distributed in specie to a shareholder
   of a company in connection with a liquidation of the company.

Renunciation of interest in trust over residential property by beneficial
owner (Section 22C)

   Where any beneficiary renounces his interest in a residential property
   that is transferred to be held on bare trust on or after 10 May 2022,
   the settlor will need to pay stamp duty i.e. BSD and ABSD on the
   transfer of the share of the residential property back to him, under
   Section 22C of the Stamp Duties Act.
   You can refer to Renunciation of Interest in Trust over residential
   property by Beneficial Owner (Section 22C) for more information.
   Example: A settlor sets up a trust where a residential property is held
   on bare trust for a sole identifiable beneficiary. The beneficiary
   later renounces his interest in the property, and a resulting trust is
   formed in favour of the settlor. The settlor is required to pay BSD and
   ABSD (based on the settlor’s profile) on the transfer of the
   residential property back to him.

Requirement to pay BSD

   You are required to pay BSD for documents executed for the transfer or
   sale and purchase of property located in Singapore. BSD will
   be computed on the purchase price as stated in the document to be
   stamped or market value of the property (whichever is the higher
   amount).

   If there is a benefit associated with the acquisition, and the benefit
   is stated in the document to be stamped and is a cash discount (i.e.
   cash, non-post dated cashier's order or cheque) to be given to the
   purchaser upon execution of the document (and not later), the amount of
   discount may be deducted from the purchase price to determine the
   consideration for stamp duty purpose. This is provided that the nett
   price is still reflective of market value.

   If the document to be stamped stated a non-cash benefit to be given
   (e.g. furniture voucher, rental guarantee, car or lucky draw), the
   value of benefit is not deductible from the purchase price for stamp
   duty purpose.

   If the cash or non- cash benefit is not stated in the document to be
   stamped, the value of the benefit is also not deductible from the
   purchase price for stamp duty purpose.

   The first instrument executed relating to a sale and purchase is liable
   to ad valorem duty (i.e. full duty). Subsequent document(s) relating to
   the same sale transaction are not liable to stamp duty.

Acquisition of property through an en-bloc purchase or “block” purchase

   Where multiple properties are acquired collectively, stamp duty will be
   calculated on the total purchase price of the multiple properties if:
    1. There is a single contract for the purchase of the multiple
       properties; or
    2. The purchases of the multiple properties are dependent and
       conditional on one another.

Stamp duty on a single contract for multiple properties

   Where there is a single contract for the purchase of multiple
   properties followed by individual documents for the purchase of each
   property, the single contract should be stamped at ad valorem duty
   based on the total purchase price.

Stamp duty on multiple documents

   Where there are multiple documents (with purchases which are dependent
   and conditional on one another), only one of the documents is required
   to be stamped at ad valorem duty, based on the total purchase price of
   all the related properties.

Rates and computation

   BSD^ is computed based on the purchase price or market value of the
   property, whichever is higher.

   Prior to 20 Feb 2018, the BSD rate was up to 3%. With effect from 20
   Feb 2018, there are differentiated BSD rates between residential and
   non-residential properties. The BSD rate for acquisition of residential
   properties from 20 Feb 2018 to 14 Feb 2023 is up to 4%. From 15 Feb
   2023, the top marginal rate for residential properties is 6%, and the
   top marginal rate for non-residential properties is 5%.

   The BSD rates are as follows:
   On or after 15 Feb 2023
   Purchase price or market value of the property BSD rates for
   residential properties BSD rates for non-residential properties
   First $180,000 1% 1%
   Next $180,000 2% 2%

   Next $500,000 4% 4%
   Next $1,500,000 5% 5%
   Remaining amount 6%

   Remaining amount                               3%

Examples

   Example 1: A terrace house was purchased on 17 Feb 2023 at $4,500,100
   which is reflective of the market value
    Market Value of the Property BSD Rate   Calculation
    First $180,000 1%   = $1,800 (1% x $180,000)
    Next $180,000   2%  = $3,600 (2% x $180,000)
    Next $640,000  3%  = $19,200 (3% x $640,000)
   Next $500,000 4% =  $20,000 (4% x $500,000)
   Next $1,500,000 5% = $75,000 (5% x $1,500,000)
   Remaining $1,500,100  6%  = $90,006 (6% x $1,500,100)
    BSD Payable    = $209,606 ($1,800 + $3,600 + $19,200 + $20,000 +
   $75,000 + $90,006)

   Example 2: A vacant land zoned “Commercial and Residential” was
   purchased on 1 Mar 2023 at $22,000,000 which is reflective of the
   market value

   Since the land is zoned “Commercial and Residential”, 60% and 40% of
   the gross floor area of the property is deemed attributable for
   residential and non-residential purposes respectively. BSD rates for
   residential and non-residential properties apply on the respective
   component.

   Value of 60% of the GFA deemed attributable for residential purposes =
   $9,000,000*

   Value of 40% of the GFA deemed attributable for commercial purposes =
   $13,000,000*

   *Valued and determined by a professional valuer.

   The BSD payable is:
   Market value of the Property BSD rate Calculation
   For the residential component
   First $180,000 1% = $1,800 (1% x $180,000)
   Next $180,000 2% = $3,600 (2% x $180,000)
   Next $640,000 3% = $19,200 (3% x $640,000)
   Next $500,000 4% = $20,000 (4% x $500,000)
   Next $1,500,000 5% = $75,000 (5% x $1,500,000)
   Remaining $6,000,000 6% = $360,000 (6% x $6,000,000)
   BSD for the residential component = $479,600 ($1,800 + $3,600 + $19,200
   + $20,000 + $75,000 + $360,000)
   For the non-residential component
   First $180,000 1% = $1,800 (1% x $180,000)
   Next $180,000 2% = $3,600 (2% x $180,000)
   Next $640,000 3% = $19,200 (3% x $640,000)
   Next $500,000 4% = $20,000 (4% x $500,000)
   Remaining $11,500,000 5% = $575,000 (5% x $11,500,000)
   BSD for the non-residential component = $619,600 ($1,800 + $3,600 +
   $19,200 + $20,000 + $575,000)
   BSD payable = $1,099,200 ($497,600 + $619,600)

I executed a contract to acquire a land zoned “White”. Its allowable use
includes residential but I would like to develop a 100% non-residential
development instead. Is the BSD payable calculated based on the BSD rates for
non-residential properties?

   As 100% GFA of the land is deemed attributable for residential purpose,
   the BSD payable would be calculated using the BSD rates for residential
   properties on the full purchase price or market value, whichever the
   higher. The BSD has to be paid within 14 days from the date of
   execution of the instrument.

   However, since you are constructing a 100% non-residential development,
   remission may be applicable. Please refer to part B of the remission
   section mentioned above, i.e. BSD remission for acquisition of
   residential land without use restriction for 100% non-residential
   development.
