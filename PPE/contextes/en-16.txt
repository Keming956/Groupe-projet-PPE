Active Duty Retirement

   Members who accumulate 20 or more years of active service are eligible
   for retirement. There are three non-disability retirement plans
   currently in effect for active duty retirees. These are Final Pay plan,
   High-36 Month Average plan, and Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986
   (more commonly referred to as REDUX) plan.

   The Final Pay plan uses a multiplier % that is 2.5% times the years of
   creditable service. The years of creditable service for an active duty
   retirement calculation is the sum of years of active service (i.e.,
   active duty or full-time National Guard duty) and any additional years
   computed by adding all reserve points, if any (except those for active
   service)and dividing by 360.

REDUX Plan

   The REDUX retirement plan is an option available only to active duty
   members who entered service on or after August 1, 1986. It includes a
   $30,000 Career Status Bonus (CSB).
--

   The years of creditable service for computation of the retired pay
   percentage multiplier include all active duty and any credited reserve
   points divided by 360.
