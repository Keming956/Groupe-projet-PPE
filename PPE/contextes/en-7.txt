Disabled people must work from home to do ‘their duty’, says UK minister

   People with mobility and mental health problems should work from home
--
   People with mobility and mental health problems will be asked to work
   from home or lose benefits as part of what a UK government minister
   described today as doing “their duty”.

   The policy will be set out on Wednesday as part of the autumn statement
--
   Laura Trott, chief secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: “Of course
   there should be support for people to help them into work but
   ultimately there is a duty on citizens if they are able to go out to
   work they should. Those who can work and contribute should contribute.”
