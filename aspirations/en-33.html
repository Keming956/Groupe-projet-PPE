<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">If a company exports a product at a price lower than the price it normally charges on its own home market, it is said to be “dumping” the product. Is this unfair competition? Opinions differ, but many governments take action against dumping in order to defend their domestic industries. The WTO agreement does not pass judgement. Its focus is on how governments can or cannot react to dumping
— it disciplines anti-dumping actions, and it is often called the “<b>Anti-Dumping Agreement</b>”. (This focus only on the reaction to dumping contrasts with the approach of the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Agreement.)</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">The legal definitions are more precise, but broadly speaking the WTO agreement allows governments to act against dumping where there is genuine (“material”) injury to the competing domestic industry. In order to do that the government has to be able to show that dumping is taking place, calculate the extent of dumping (how much lower the export price is compared to the exporter’s home market price), and show that the dumping is causing injury or threatening to do so.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">GATT (Article 6) allows countries to take action against dumping. The Anti-Dumping Agreement clarifies and expands Article 6, and the two operate together. They allow countries to act in a way that would normally break the GATT principles of
<a href="fact2_e.htm#bind"> binding</a> a tariff and <a href="fact2_e.htm#mfn"> not discriminating</a> between trading partners
— typically anti-dumping action means charging extra import duty on the particular product from the particular exporting country in order to bring its price closer to the “normal value” or to remove the injury to domestic industry in the importing country.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">There are many different ways of calculating whether a particular product is being dumped heavily or only lightly. The agreement narrows down the range of possible options. It provides three methods to calculate a product’s “normal value”. The main one is based on the price in the exporter’s domestic market. When this cannot be used, two alternatives are available
— the price charged by the exporter in another country, or a calculation based on the combination of the exporter’s production costs, other expenses and normal profit margins. And the agreement also specifies how a fair comparison can be made between the export price and what would be a normal price.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">Calculating the extent of dumping on a product is not enough. Anti-dumping measures can only be applied if the dumping is hurting the industry in the importing country. Therefore, a detailed investigation has to be conducted according to specified rules first. The investigation must evaluate all relevant economic factors that have a bearing on the state of the industry in question. If the investigation shows dumping is taking place and domestic industry is being hurt, the exporting company can undertake to raise its price to an agreed level in order to avoid anti-dumping import duty.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">Detailed procedures are set out on how anti-dumping cases are to be initiated, how the investigations are to be conducted, and the conditions for ensuring that all interested parties are given an opportunity to present evidence. Anti-dumping measures must expire five years after the date of imposition, unless an investigation shows that ending the measure would lead to injury.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">Anti-dumping investigations are to end immediately in cases where the authorities determine that the margin of dumping is insignificantly small (defined as less than 2% of the export price of the product). Other conditions are also set. For example, the investigations also have to end if the volume of dumped imports is negligible (i.e. if the volume from one country is less than 3% of total imports of that product
— although investigations can proceed if several countries, each supplying less than 3% of the imports, together account for 7% or more of total imports).</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">The agreement says member countries must inform the Committee on Anti-Dumping Practices about all preliminary and final anti-dumping actions, promptly and in detail. They must also report on all investigations twice a year. When differences arise, members are encouraged to consult each other. They can also use the WTO’s dispute settlement procedure.</p>

          and countervailing measures <span class="paranormaltext"> </span></h2>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">This agreement does two things: it disciplines the use of subsidies, and it regulates the actions countries can take to counter the effects of subsidies. It says a country can use the WTO’s
<a href="disp1_e.htm"> dispute settlement procedure</a> to seek the withdrawal of the subsidy or the removal of its adverse effects. Or the country can launch its own investigation and ultimately charge extra duty (known as “countervailing duty”) on subsidized imports that are found to be hurting domestic producers.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">The agreement contains a definition of subsidy. It also introduces the concept of a “specific” subsidy
— i.e. a subsidy available only to an enterprise, industry, group of enterprises, or group of industries in the country (or state, etc) that gives the subsidy. The disciplines set out in the agreement only apply to specific subsidies. They can be domestic or export subsidies.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">The agreement defines two categories of subsidies: prohibited and actionable. It originally contained a third category: non-actionable subsidies. This category existed for five years, ending on 31 December 1999, and was not extended. The agreement applies to agricultural goods as well as industrial products, except when the subsidies are exempt under the Agriculture Agreement’s “peace clause”, due to expire at the end of 2003.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">
<img src="../../../../images/redbulle.gif" width="14" height="14"><b>	Prohibited subsidies:</b> subsidies that require recipients to meet certain export targets, or to use domestic goods instead of imported goods. They are prohibited because they are specifically designed to distort international trade, and are therefore likely to hurt other countries’ trade. They can be challenged in the WTO dispute settlement procedure where they are handled under an accelerated timetable. If the dispute settlement procedure confirms that the subsidy is prohibited, it must be withdrawn immediately. Otherwise, the complaining country can take counter measures. If domestic producers are hurt by imports of subsidized products, countervailing duty can be imposed.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">
<img src="../../../../images/redbulle.gif" width="14" height="14"> <b>Actionable subsidies:</b> in this category the complaining country has to show that the subsidy has an adverse effect on its interests. Otherwise the subsidy is permitted. The agreement defines three types of damage they can cause. One country’s subsidies can hurt a domestic industry in an importing country. They can hurt rival exporters from another country when the two compete in third markets. And domestic subsidies in one country can hurt exporters trying to compete in the subsidizing country’s domestic market. If the Dispute Settlement Body rules that the subsidy does have an adverse effect, the subsidy must be withdrawn or its adverse effect must be removed. Again, if domestic producers are hurt by imports of subsidized products, countervailing duty can be imposed.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">Some of the disciplines are similar to those of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. Countervailing duty (the parallel of anti-dumping duty) can only be charged after the importing country has conducted a detailed investigation similar to that required for anti-dumping action. There are detailed rules for deciding whether a product is being subsidized (not always an easy calculation), criteria for determining whether imports of subsidized products are hurting (“causing injury to”) domestic industry, procedures for initiating and conducting investigations, and rules on the implementation and duration (normally five years) of countervailing measures. The subsidized exporter can also agree to raise its export prices as an alternative to its exports being charged countervailing duty.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">Subsidies may play an important role in developing countries and in the transformation of centrally-planned economies to market economies. Least-developed countries and developing countries with less than $1,000 per capita GNP are exempted from disciplines on prohibited export subsidies. Other developing countries are given until 2003 to get rid of their export subsidies. Least-developed countries must eliminate import-substitution subsidies (i.e. subsidies designed to help domestic production and avoid importing) by 2003
— for other developing countries the deadline was 2000. Developing countries also receive preferential treatment if their exports are subject to countervailing duty investigations. For transition economies, prohibited subsidies had to be phased out by 2002.</p>

        <a href="#top" class="backToTop">back&nbsp;to&nbsp;top</a><h2 id="safeguards">Safeguards: emergency
          protection from imports <span class="paranormaltext"> </span></h2>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">A WTO member may restrict imports of a product temporarily (take “safeguard” actions) if its domestic industry is injured or threatened with injury caused by a surge in imports. Here, the injury has to be serious. Safeguard measures were always available under GATT (Article 19). However, they were infrequently used, some governments preferring to protect their domestic industries through “grey area” measures
— using bilateral negotiations outside GATT’s auspices, they persuaded exporting countries to restrain exports “voluntarily” or to agree to other means of sharing markets. Agreements of this kind were reached for a wide range of products: automobiles, steel, and semiconductors, for example.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">The WTO agreement broke new ground. It prohibits “grey-area” measures, and it sets time limits (a “sunset clause”) on all safeguard actions. The agreement says members must not seek, take or maintain any voluntary export restraints, orderly marketing arrangements or any other similar measures on the export or the import side. The bilateral measures that were not modified to conform with the agreement were phased out at the end of 1998. Countries were allowed to keep one of these measures an extra year (until the end of 1999), but only the European Union
— for restrictions on imports of cars from Japan — made use of this provision.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">An import “surge” justifying safeguard action can be a real increase in imports (an
<i> absolute increase</i>); or it can be an increase in the imports’ share of a shrinking market, even if the import quantity has not increased
(<i>relative increase</i>).</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">Industries or companies may request safeguard action by their government. The WTO agreement sets out requirements for safeguard investigations by national authorities. The emphasis is on transparency and on following established rules and practices
— avoiding arbitrary methods. The authorities conducting investigations have to announce publicly when hearings are to take place and provide other appropriate means for interested parties to present evidence. The evidence must include arguments on whether a measure is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">The agreement sets out criteria for assessing whether “serious injury” is being caused or threatened, and the factors which must be considered in determining the impact of imports on the domestic industry. When imposed, a safeguard measure should be applied only to the extent necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to help the industry concerned to adjust. Where quantitative restrictions (quotas) are imposed, they normally should not reduce the quantities of imports below the annual average for the last three representative years for which statistics are available, unless clear justification is given that a different level is necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">In principle, safeguard measures cannot be targeted at imports from a particular country. However, the agreement does describe how quotas can be allocated among supplying countries, including in the exceptional circumstance where imports from certain countries have increased disproportionately quickly. A safeguard measure should not last more than four years, although this can be extended up to eight years, subject to a determination by competent national authorities that the measure is needed and that there is evidence the industry is adjusting. Measures imposed for more than a year must be progressively liberalized.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">When a country restricts imports in order to safeguard its domestic producers, in principle it must give something in return. The agreement says the exporting country (or exporting countries) can seek compensation through consultations. If no agreement is reached the exporting country can retaliate by taking equivalent action
— for instance, it can raise tariffs on exports from the country that is enforcing the safeguard measure. In some circumstances, the exporting country has to wait for three years after the safeguard measure was introduced before it can retaliate in this way
— i.e. if the measure conforms with the provisions of the agreement and if it is taken as a result of an increase in the quantity of imports from the exporting country.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">To some extent developing countries’ exports are shielded from safeguard actions. An importing country can only apply a safeguard measure to a product from a developing country if the developing country is supplying more than 3% of the imports of that product, or if developing country members with less than 3% import share collectively account for more than 9% of total imports of the product concerned.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext" align="left">The WTO’s Safeguards Committee oversees the operation of the agreement and is responsible for the surveillance of members’ commitments. Governments have to report each phase of a safeguard investigation and related decision-making, and the committee reviews these reports.</p>

                <p class="parasmalltext" align="left">People sometimes refer to the two together
                  — “AD-CVD” — but there are fundamental differences</p>
                <p class="parasmalltext" align="left">Dumping and subsidies — together with anti-dumping
                  (AD) measures and countervailing duties (CVD) — share a number
                  of similarities. Many countries handle the two under a single
                  law, apply a similar process to deal with them and give a single
                  authority responsibility for investigations. Occasionally, the
                  two WTO committees responsible for these issues meet jointly.</p>
                <p class="parasmalltext" align="left">The reaction to dumping and subsidies is
                  often a special offsetting import tax (countervailing duty in
                  the case of a subsidy). This is charged on products from specific
                  countries and therefore it breaks the GATT principles of <a href="fact2_e.htm#bind">
                  binding</a> a tariff and treating trading partners equally (<a href="fact2_e.htm#mfn">MFN</a>).
                  The agreements provide an escape clause, but they both also
                  say that before imposing a duty, the importing country must
                  conduct a detailed investigation that shows properly that domestic
                  industry is hurt.</p>
                <p class="parasmalltext" align="left">But there are also fundamental differences,
                  and these are reflected in the agreements.</p>
                <p class="parasmalltext" align="left">Dumping is an action by a company. With
                  subsidies, it is the government or a government agency that
                  acts, either by paying out subsidies directly or by requiring
                  companies to subsidize certain customers.</p>
                <p class="parasmalltext" align="left">But the WTO is an organization of countries
                  and their governments. The WTO does not deal with companies
                  and cannot regulate companies’ actions such as dumping. Therefore
                  the Anti-Dumping Agreement only concerns the actions governments
                  may take against dumping. With subsidies, governments act on
                  both sides: they subsidize and they act against each others’
                  subsidies. Therefore the subsidies agreement disciplines both
                  the subsidies and the reactions.</p>
