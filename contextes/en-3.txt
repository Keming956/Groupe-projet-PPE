               o A fixed duty of $10 is payable on the Declaration of
                 Trust/Trust deed which does not result in a change in
                 beneficial interest in the property.
               o Where there is a change in beneficial interest in the
                 property, ad valorem stamp duty will be payable on the

   Where any beneficiary renounces his interest in a residential property
   that is transferred to be held on bare trust on or after 10 May 2022,
   the settlor will need to pay stamp duty i.e. BSD and ABSD on the
   transfer of the share of the residential property back to him, under

   purchaser upon execution of the document (and not later), the amount of
   discount may be deducted from the purchase price to determine the
   consideration for stamp duty purpose. This is provided that the nett
   price is still reflective of market value.

--
   (e.g. furniture voucher, rental guarantee, car or lucky draw), the
   value of benefit is not deductible from the purchase price for stamp
   duty purpose.

   If the cash or non- cash benefit is not stated in the document to be
   stamped, the value of the benefit is also not deductible from the
   purchase price for stamp duty purpose.

   The first instrument executed relating to a sale and purchase is liable
   to ad valorem duty (i.e. full duty). Subsequent document(s) relating to
   the same sale transaction are not liable to stamp duty.

Acquisition of property through an en-bloc purchase or “block” purchase

   Where multiple properties are acquired collectively, stamp duty will be
   calculated on the total purchase price of the multiple properties if:
    1. There is a single contract for the purchase of the multiple
--
       conditional on one another.

Stamp duty on a single contract for multiple properties

   Where there is a single contract for the purchase of multiple
   properties followed by individual documents for the purchase of each
   property, the single contract should be stamped at ad valorem duty
   based on the total purchase price.

Stamp duty on multiple documents

   Where there are multiple documents (with purchases which are dependent
   and conditional on one another), only one of the documents is required
   to be stamped at ad valorem duty, based on the total purchase price of
   all the related properties.

Can the contracting parties change the date of instrument to avoid paying
higher duty?

   No. The Commissioner of Stamp Duties takes a serious view of any
   attempt to evade or reduce the incidence of duties. Evasion of duties
   is an offence under section 62 of the Stamp Duties Act. Any person
   guilty of such an offence shall be liable on conviction to a fine of up
   to $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term of up to 3 years or to both.
   The Commissioner of Stamp Duties may also disregard or vary any
   arrangements meant to evade or reduce the incidence of duty, and impose
   the duty (including late stamping penalties, if applicable) which would
   otherwise be payable.

Can I pay BSD using my Central Provident Fund (CPF) money?

   Using CPF funds to pay stamp duty is subject to the terms and
   conditions under the Private Properties and Public Housing Schemes. You
   may wish to check with CPF Board for more details.
