Overview

   When you buy shares, you usually pay a tax or duty of 0.5% on the
   transaction.

   If you buy:
     * shares electronically, you’ll pay Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT)
     * shares using a stock transfer form, you’ll pay Stamp Duty if the
       transaction is over £1,000

--
     * buy units in a unit trust from the fund manager

   You do not normally have to pay Stamp Duty or SDRT if you buy foreign
   shares outside the UK. But you may have to pay other taxes.
