   If you’re sent alcohol or tobacco from outside the UK, you’ll be
   charged Excise Duty at current rates.

   Excise Duty was included in the price. If it’s not, your goods may be
   seized.

   If you receive large amounts of alcohol or tobacco for your business,
   use the Trade Tariff service to check duty rates.

   Your goods can also be seized if they’re:

     * cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco without UK health warnings or
       fiscal marks
