Excise duties on alcohol, tobacco and energy

   Excise duties are indirect taxes on the sale or use of specific
   products, such as alcohol, tobacco and energy. The revenue from these
   excise duties goes entirely to the country to which they are paid.

   EU countries agreed on common EU rules to make sure that excise duties
   are applied in the same way and to the same products everywhere in the
   Union.
--

   In addition, EU law sets out [79]common provisions, which apply to all
   products subject to excise duties. These common provisions include the
   framework for the [80]Excise Monitoring and Control System (EMCS), an
   IT system for monitoring the movement of excise goods within the EU.
