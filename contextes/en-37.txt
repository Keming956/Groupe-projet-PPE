duty

/ˈdudi/
--
   [10]IPA guide

   Other forms: duties

   When you've done your duty, you've done what you're supposed to and met
   your responsibilities. Your sense of duty as a citizen might compel you
   to vote; it might also keep you from voting twice.

   A duty is an obligation, and we get new duties with new positions in
   life, like taking a job, or becoming a parent. You didn't realize one
   of your duties as club president would be cleaning up after meetings. A
   police officer or cab driver can be on-duty or off-duty. As an off-duty
   police officer, you might still feel it's your duty to stop a robbery.
   Duty also means "tax," which is why people like shopping duty-free at
   the airport.
