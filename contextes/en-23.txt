1. Introduction

   This part concentrates on goods liable to excise duty. It lists the
   rates of excise duty chargeable for the following:
     * wine and made-wine
     * beer
--
     * biofuels

   Use this guide with the [56]Trade Tariff: look up commodity codes, duty
   and VAT rates to help with commodity code numbers (for example, 2204 10
   11 for certain wines).

   This part also contains some information and reference about excise
   drawback and excise duty reliefs.

1.1 Important note on definitions

   The definitions used in this part are those prescribed for excise duty
   purposes only.

1.2 Background

   Excise duty is chargeable, in addition to any customs duty which may be
   due, on the goods described in this part. These goods may be either of
   UK origin, received in the UK following an intra EU movement or
   imported from outside the UK or EU.

   The duty falls due at the time when the goods leave any duty suspension
   arrangements, that is when:
     * they are released for consumption or otherwise made available for
--
   addition to the commodity description and code number each excisable
   item has allocated a tax type code number (for example, 451 for
   spirits). These identify the type and rate of excise duty payable. They
   are included in the tables listed in section [57]Wine and made-wine.
   [58]UK Trade Tariff: Box 47(a) tax type codes also lists tax codes

3. Beer

   Class or description Tax type code Rate of excise duty
   Made in UK (standard rate, that is, annual production more than 60,000
   hectolitres) 407 £19.08 for each hectolitre per 1% ABV charged to the
--
   respective proportionate charges for parts of hectolitres)

   Reduced rates of duty were introduced from 1 June 2002 for beer
   produced by independent breweries producing no more than 30,000
   hectolitres. For breweries producing between 5,000 and 30,000
   hectolitres, the following arithmetical formula is used to calculate
   the rate of duty.

   (Annual production — 2,500) ÷ annual production × standard rate of duty
   at the time concerned. This must be rounded up to the nearest penny.

   Reduced rates of duty were also introduced from 1 June 2004 for beer
   produced by independent breweries producing between 30,000 and 60,000
   hectolitres.

   The following arithmetical formula is used to calculate the rate of
   duty for these breweries.

   (Annual production — (2,500 — 8.3% ABV of annual production in excess
   of 30,000 hectolitres)) × standard rate of duty at the time concerned ÷
   annual production.

--
   beer.

   The duty is charged on alcoholic strength to one decimal place, for
   example 4.19% ABV becomes 4.1% ABV (ignore figures after the first
   decimal place).

   Low alcohol beverages made from malt exceeding 0.5% ABV but not
   exceeding 1.2% ABV are not liable to excise duty.

   Examples of beer-based beverages are set out in the section on [61]Low
   alcohol beverages which also shows the rate of excise duty for these
   products up to 5.5% ABV. Beer and spirits mixtures exceeding 1.2% ABV
   are liable to duty at the spirits rate. Beer mixtures containing
   dutiable liquors other than spirits and exceeding 5.5% ABV are liable
   at the appropriate made-wine rate.

   If spirits are imported in bottles which the importer does not wish to

   strength exceeding 1.2% ABV but not exceeding 5.5% ABV.

     * one where the alcohol by volume content exceeds 1.2% ABV but does
       not exceed 2.8% ABV

   The Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979 (HODA) specifies full rates of
   excise duty on mineral oils and rebates of duty. The effect of applying
   a rebate of duty to a full rate is to create a lower rate of duty.
   These lower rates are known as rebated rates. This mechanism increases
   the number of effective rates of mineral oils excise duty.

9.3 For the purpose of these duties

   ‘Hydrocarbon oil’ means petroleum oils, coal tar, and oils produced
--

   ‘Rebated oil’ means oil which has been delivered for home use on
   allowance of a rebate of excise duty under the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties
   Act 1979, sections 11 and 14.

   Supplementary information about the duty on hydrocarbon oil.

   Eligibility for rebate, as set out, is restricted as follows.
--
   be observed are set out in [76]Excise Notice 179.

   The excise duty on hydrocarbon oil removed to a refinery, instead of
   being charged at the time of importation, is charged on the delivery of
   any goods from the refinery for home use, and is the same as that which
   would be payable on the importation of like goods. It is therefore
   allowed the same rebate as would be allowed on importation. Any customs
   duty chargeable is payable when the oil is taken into use at the
   refinery, whether as feedstock or otherwise.

   From 15 October 1993 the unit for calculation of duty on hydrocarbon
   oils is the standard litre, that is, litres at 15°C. If not already
   expressed in those terms quantities will need to be converted. Further
--

   It’s illegal for any person to mix any oil on which no rebate of excise
   duty has been allowed with:
     * fuel oil, gas oil, kerosene or light oil (including unleaded
       petrol) on which rebate of excise duty has been allowed
     * oil delivered without payment of excise duty

   except under and in accordance with either an approval granted by the
--

   Goods containing mineral oils as a part or ingredient of them are not
   liable to excise duty unless they are intended for use as substitutes
   for road fuels or as additives to road fuels or road fuel substitutes.
   Any articles imported for these purposes are chargeable with UK excise
   duty on 100% of their volume (not only on the percentage of mineral
   oil, if any, contained within them). The tax type codes and excise duty
   rates to be applied are the same as for the type of mineral oil which
   the product is intended to substitute for or is to be added to.

   Lubricating oils will not be charged with UK excise duty unless they
   are to be added to an additives package, in which case excise duty will
   be charged on the whole package.
