Duty suspensions and autonomous tariff quotas

   Duty suspensions are designed to help UK and Crown Dependency
   (Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey) businesses remain competitive in
   the global marketplace. They do this by suspending import duties on
   certain goods, normally those used in domestic production.

   These suspensions do not apply to other duties that may be chargeable
   like VAT or trade remedies duty, such as anti-dumping duty.

   Duty suspensions allow unlimited quantities to be imported into the UK
   at a reduced tariff rate. Autonomous tariff quotas (ATQs) allow limited
   quantities to be imported at a reduced rate.

   Duty suspensions and ATQs are temporary and can be used by any UK
   business while in force. They are applied on a ‘Most Favoured Nation’
   (‘MFN’) basis. This means that goods subject to these suspensions or

   you are importing goods subject to a duty suspension or an ATQ into
   Northern Ireland.

Current duty suspensions

   Find the current duty suspensions and quotas using the Trade Tariff
   lookup tool.

   Duty suspensions for products which previously existed in the UK under
   the EU suspensions regime have been carried over into the UK’s
   independent regime. They have been retained, provided they came into
--
   continuity for UK businesses.

   All current duty suspensions rolled over from the EU regime,
   including EU ATQs changed to duty suspensions, are extended until 31
   December 2028.
