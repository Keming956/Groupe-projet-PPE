   obligations related to protecting the interests of beneficiaries
   include the following duties.

Duty of Care
--
   This pertains to acting in the best interest of the beneficiary at all
   times, putting their well-being first and foremost. It includes the
   duty of the fiduciary to excuse themself from taking actions when
   there's a conflict of interest with the beneficiary's welfare.

Duty of Good Faith

   interests of the beneficiary. At no time should the fiduciary take
   actions that are outside of legal constraints.
--
   Fiduciaries must engage in completely forthright behavior, disclosing

   ability to carry out their duties as fiduciary and/or on the well-being
   of a beneficiary's interests.

   types of beneficiaries. Such relationships include, among others,
   lawyers acting for clients, company executives acting for stockholders,
--
   investors, and trustees acting for estate beneficiaries.

   employers have a right to expect that employees are acting in their
   best interests. For example, they are not sharing trade secrets, or
--
   from a competitor.

Elements of a Fiduciary Breach Claim
--
   A number of legal precedents and elements have been established to
   allow claims by those who have been harmed by a breach of fiduciary
   duty. Jurisdictions differ, but in general, the following four elements
   are essential if a plaintiff is to prevail in a breach of fiduciary
   duty claim.

A Duty Existed

   The plaintiff must show that a legal fiduciary duty existed. Many
   professionals are obligated, legally and ethically, to conduct their
   businesses honestly. However, that doesn't mean that they are
   fiduciaries who must act solely in the interest of a particular client.
   A fiduciary duty is accepted as such by a fiduciary, typically in
   writing.

A Breach Occurred

   The plaintiff must show that a fiduciary duty was breached. The type of
   breach varies in every case. For example, if an accountant was sloppy
   in filling out a client's tax returns, and the client was slapped with
   an enormous fine for nonpayment, the accountant may be guilty of a
   breach of fiduciary duty. However, if the client was sloppy and failed
   to provide complete and necessary information, no breach occurred.

--
   The plaintiff must show that the breach of trust caused actual damage.
   Without damage, there is usually no basis for a breach of fiduciary
   duty case. The more specific a principal or beneficiary can be with
   facts of damage, the better.

--
   clearly a conflict of interest. However, a specific accounting relating
   to the loss to the beneficiary is needed to prove a breach of fiduciary
   duty.

Causation Was Proved

   Causation shows that any damages incurred by the plaintiff were
   directly linked with the actions taken in breach of fiduciary duty. In
   the above example of a property sale, the link appears to be clear.
   However, the trustee might argue that a quick sale was in the best

   If you suspect your [177]financial adviser is in breach of their
   fiduciary duty, you can file a complaint with [178]FINRA, the [179]SEC,
   or both. If your adviser has a professional certification, you can also
   notify the entity that provided the credential.

A Duty of Loyalty

   One example of a breach in fiduciary duty case went to the Virginia
   Supreme Court in 2007.

--

   In this case, the question of whether the employees had a fiduciary
   duty to their former employer, and breached it, was fundamental to the
   appeal that brought the case to the state's highest court.

   The court affirmed the lower court's ruling that the employees owed
   Mario a duty of loyalty. In effect, it supported the claim of a breach
   of fiduciary duty, and a penalty of more than $1 million.

A Menswear Store vs. Ex-Employees

   when it sued two of its former sales professionals for taking a job

   The adjective fiduciary means held or given in trust. In accepting a
   fiduciary duty, an individual or entity accepts a legal commitment to
   act in the best interests of a beneficiary.

What Are the Main Fiduciary Duties?

   There are several types of fiduciary duties. One is the duty of loyalty
   which implies that the fiduciary will always act in the best interests
   of the beneficiary or principal. Duty of care is another. It means that
--
   regarding a beneficiary's well-being. No conflicting interest will be
   permitted to influence the fiduciary's actions on behalf of the client.
   Duty to disclose is a third. It refers to the duty a fiduciary has to
   disclose any conflict of interest they may have when acting on behalf
   of a beneficiary.
--
   acting for a principal.

   However, any individual may, in some cases, have a fiduciary duty to
   another person or entity. For example, an employee may be found to have
   a duty of loyalty to an employer and may be legally liable if they
   cause harm to the employer by misusing information or resources
   entrusted to them.
--
The Bottom Line

   Fiduciary duties refer to the ways that a fiduciary is legally
   committed to act for a principal or beneficiary. They include a duty of
   loyalty, a duty of care, a duty of prudence, a duty of confidentiality,
   and more.

   Fiduciary duties are meant to ensure that the fiduciary acts only in
   the best interests of a principal or beneficiary. What's more, the
   fiduciary must act diligently to protect those interests.
