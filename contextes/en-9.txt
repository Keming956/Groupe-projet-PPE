   imposed on someone, to perform something which is morally, legally or

--
   the normal course of action in general or in specific circumstances.

   The law governing the country has specified certain duties which must
   be followed by every citizen. It exhibits an invisible force which
   binds a person to do something which is considered right in the eyes of
--
   of an individual’s position, occupation or role.

   The points given below are substantial so far as the difference between
   duty and responsibility is concerned:
    1. Duty refers to the legal or moral obligation, or commitment towards
       certain work, which you are expected to perform, in general, or
--
    5. Duties are imputed on a person, either naturally or out of the
       role/position he occupies. On the other hand, responsibility is
       nothing but demanded duties, which are shouldered on a person who
       is competent and conscientious enough to handle it.

Conclusion

   Duty brings responsibility, i.e. when you say it is your duty, it
   indicates that you ought to do that because you are responsible for
   that act if it is not done properly, within the reasonable time. It
   requires allegiance on the part of the concerned individual, for the
   discharge of duties and responsibilities successfully.
