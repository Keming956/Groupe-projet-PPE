Reducing CO₂ emissions from heavy-duty vehicles

   In 2023, the Commission proposed a revision of the Regulation on CO[2]
   emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles. If adopted, the proposal
   would introduce new, stronger CO[2] emission standards for heavy-duty
   vehicles from 2030 onwards, and extend the scope of the Regulation to
   cover smaller trucks, city buses, long-distance buses and trailers.
--

   The new targets build on those adopted in 2019, which were the
   first-ever EU-wide CO[2] emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles.

   To enter into force, the Commission’s proposal now needs to be adopted

Regulation on CO₂ emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles

   Until the revision is adopted, the Regulation on CO2 emission standards
   for heavy-duty vehicles applies. This Regulation entered into force on
   14 August 2019.

   As a first step, the CO[2] emission standards cover large lorries,
   which account for over 73% of all CO[2] emissions from heavy-duty
   vehicles.

--

   As a result, the average specific CO[2] emissions of a manufacturer are
   adjusted downwards if the share of ZLEV in its entire new heavy-duty
   vehicles fleet exceeds the 2% benchmark, out of which at least 0.75
   percentage points have to be vehicles subject to the CO[2] targets,

   onwards): :
     * Member States monitor and report to the Commission information on
       the heavy-duty vehicles registered for the first time in the Union;
     * Lorry manufacturers monitor and report to the Commission CO[2]
       emission and fuel consumption data as determined pursuant to the

   VECTO is a simulation software that can be used cost-efficiently and
   reliably to measure the CO[2] emissions and fuel consumption of
   heavy-duty vehicles for specific loads, fuels and mission profiles
   (e.g. long haul, regional delivery, urban delivery, etc.), based on
   input data from relevant vehicle components.
