   duties from the customs authorities, your postal operator or the
   courier. This invoice must be paid before the goods are handed over to
   you.

   See [81]how excise duties are  calculated in the EU Member States.

--
   Some commercial websites may offer to show a value on the customs
   declaration that is much lower than the actual price paid so that you
   don't have to pay duty and/or pay lower VAT. This may also result in
   seizure of the goods and/or additional costs and possible a fine at
   delivery.

   tobacco or tobacco products and alcoholic products which are subject to
   special duty-free limits on the quantity provided.

Excise duty in detail

   Excise duties are indirect taxes on the sale or use of specific
   products, such as alcohol and tobacco, and are payable on these goods
   on entry into the EU. EU legislation sets out only minimum levels of
   excise duty above which individual Member States are free to set their
   own rates. You can check the [87]excise duty rates applied on the goods
   concerned through the [88]Taxes in Europe database. Besides the list of
   excise products at EU level, Member States have national lists of
