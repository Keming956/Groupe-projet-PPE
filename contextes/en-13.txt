Overview

   Conveyance duty, commonly known as stamp duty, is a tax you pay when
   you buy property in the ACT, whether it’s a home, land, or a commercial
   property.

   The Government is continuing to reduce conveyance duty rates for
   residential properties.

   Since 1 July 2021, eligible owner-occupiers of residential properties
   have paid a reduced rate of conveyance duty. On or after 1 July 2023,
   duty on owner-occupier purchases up to $260,000 will be at the lower
   rate of 0.49%.

   From 1 July 2023, commercial properties with a dutiable value of
   $1,800,000 or less will pay no conveyance duty. Where the value is
   greater than $1,800,000 a flat rate of 5 per cent will apply.

Calculating your duty

   The amount of duty you pay depends on the property’s purchase price or
   market value (being the greater of).
     * If you buy a property that already has a building on it, you
       pay duty on the combined value of the house and the land. This
       includes a home purchased under the land rent scheme.
     * If you buy a block of land that doesn’t have a house on it, but the
       seller is building one on the land before you settle as part of
       your contract, you still pay duty on the combined value of the
       house and the land. Examples include house-and-land packages and
       off-the-plan property purchases.

   If you buy land under one contract and arrange to build a house on the
   land under a separate contract, you pay duty on the land contract only.
   This also includes land under the land rent scheme.
