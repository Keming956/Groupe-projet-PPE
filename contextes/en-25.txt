General description of the measure

   This measure sets out how tobacco duties will increase on 22 November
   2023.

Policy objective

   The government is committed to maintaining high tobacco duty rates.
   This is an established tool to reduce smoking prevalence and ensure
   that tobacco duties continue to contribute to government revenues.

   The ‘tobacco duty escalator’, which increases duty in line with the
   Retail Price Index (RPI) +2% at each Budget, was extended at Budget
   2020 until the end of the current Parliament. In addition, increasing
   the duty rate on hand-rolling tobacco above the duty escalator will
   narrow the gap between hand-rolling tobacco and cigarette duty rates.

Background to the measure

   As announced at Autumn Statement 2023, the duty rate on all tobacco
   products will increase by the tobacco duty escalator of 2% above RPI
   inflation. The duty rate for hand-rolling tobacco will rise by an
   additional 10%, to 12% above RPI inflation. These changes will apply
   from 6pm on 22 November 2023.
--
Operative date

   The new tobacco duty rates will have effect from 6pm on 22 November
   2023.

Current law

   The table of duty rates on tobacco products is in Schedule 1 to the
   Tobacco Products Duty Act 1979 (TPDA).

--

   Legislation will be introduced in Autumn Finance Bill 2023 to increase
   the rates of duty on tobacco products. The legislation will amend
   Schedule 1 to the TPDA and makes consequential changes to the
   simplified calculations contained within the Travellers’ Allowances
--
Equalities impacts

   Due to differences in tobacco consumption, any change to tobacco duties
   will have equalities impacts. Men (14.6%)  are slightly more likely to
   smoke than women (11.2%).
--

   This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on fewer than 30
   manufacturers and importers. They will face an increase in tobacco duty
   rates that they are likely to pass on to consumers.
