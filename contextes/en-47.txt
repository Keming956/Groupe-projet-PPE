Proving originating status and claiming a reduced rate of Customs Duty for
trade between the UK and EU

--
   The Origin Procedures in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (Articles
   37 to 67) set out the process for goods to prove their originating
   status and how a reduced rate of Customs Duty (known as a tariff
   preference) can be claimed.

--
   as long as it is made within 3 years of the importation date and
   accompanied with a valid proof of origin. In those circumstances any
   duties would be repaid to the importer.

   You can claim preference for different goods on the same document.
--
   requirement is that those goods are clearly indicated.

   In the UK, a claim for duties to be repaid is made using C285, however
   there are different ways to claim the preferential rate of duty
   depending on which system youâ€™re using to make your import declaration.

--
   evidence to show that the goods you exported to the EU originate in the
   UK, your EU customer will be liable to pay the full rate of Customs
   Duty.
