   management, education, ethics and so forth. These are commonly used
   with one another, but they are two different terms, wherein the duty is
   imposed on someone, to perform something which is morally, legally or
   professionally considered right. It is something which we are required

Definition of Duty

   Duty can be defined as a moral, legal, or professional obligation which
   a person is bound to do, otherwise, he/she has to face certain
   punishment or penalty. It determines what a person should have done in
   the normal course of action in general or in specific circumstances.

   The law governing the country has specified certain duties which must
   be followed by every citizen. It exhibits an invisible force which
   binds a person to do something which is considered right in the eyes of
   law, whose non-performance may result in fine or punishment.

   Duty is the obligatory task, conduct, work or service, that emerge out
   of an individual’s position, occupation or role.

   In management, the word ‘duty’ is used to define the tasks or functions
   which an employee has to perform, as it is a part of his/her job.

   In economics, duty is described as a form of tax levied by the
   government on the goods purchased from or sold to foreign countries.
   The non-payment of such taxes may result in a penalty to the exporter
   or importer.

Definition of Responsibility

   Responsibility refers to a state of having some authority or obligation
   to undertake a task satisfactorily which has been assigned by someone
   who is superior or elder, so as to attain the desired results. It is
   required to be undertaken as a part of a job or role.

   It makes a person answerable or accountable for the completion of the
   task, or safekeeping of valuables/cash, or protection of a person.
   Hence, the person who accepts the responsibility has to be ready to
   bear the consequences, for his/her actions or decisions taken in this
   regard, which may be positive or negative.

   Responsibility often comes with the authority to give directions and
   take relevant actions when required. When authority is delegated to a
   person, he/she becomes responsible for its performance and the optimum
   use of the delegated authority.

   It reflects the trust of the person delegating the authority on the
   person to whom it is delegated, that the task will be completed
   accordingly.

Key Differences Between Duty and Responsibility

   The points given below are substantial so far as the difference between
   duty and responsibility is concerned:
    1. Duty refers to the legal or moral obligation, or commitment towards
       certain work, which you are expected to perform, in general, or
       special circumstances. On the contrary, responsibility refers to
       the liability that requires fulfilment which is either assumed,
       voluntarily accepted or promised, by an individual, inherent to
       his/her job or role.
    2. Duties show a hidden binding force that impels a person to do a
       certain act, which is regarded as the right thing to do in a
       particular situation. As against, responsibility brings authority,
       i.e. the power to take necessary decisions and actions and give
       proper directions for the successful completion.
    3. Duties exhibits respect, sincerity, of the person towards the work
       (task), elders and superiors and obedience. Conversely,
       Responsibility gives birth to accountability, i.e. acceptance of
       certain responsibility by a person makes him/her accountable for
       its performance.
    4. Duty requires the sacrifice of self-interest by the person to whom
       it is ascribed. In contrast, responsibility demands trustworthiness
       and loyalty, i.e. the person to whom the responsibility of a
       certain task is given must be trustworthy and loyal to perform the
       tasks as required.
    5. Duties are imputed on a person, either naturally or out of the
       role/position he occupies. On the other hand, responsibility is
       nothing but demanded duties, which are shouldered on a person who
       is competent and conscientious enough to handle it.

Conclusion

   Duty brings responsibility, i.e. when you say it is your duty, it
   indicates that you ought to do that because you are responsible for
   that act if it is not done properly, within the reasonable time. It
   requires allegiance on the part of the concerned individual, for the
   discharge of duties and responsibilities successfully.
