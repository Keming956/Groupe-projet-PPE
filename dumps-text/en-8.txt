   Chandigarh: An officer of the Superintendent of Police (SP) rank in
   Punjab has been suspended for alleged dereliction of duty in connection
   with the security breach during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to
   the state in January last year.

   The officer, Gurbinder Singh, was at the time of the incident posted as
   the Superintendent of Police (Operations) and was on duty in Ferozepur.

   Singh, currently posted as an SP in Bathinda district, has been
   suspended with immediate effect, according to an order issued by the
   Punjab Home Department on Wednesday.

   On January 5, 2022, Prime Minister Modi's convoy was stranded on a
   flyover due to a blockade by protesters in Ferozepur after which he
   returned from Punjab without attending any of the events, including a
   rally. The security breach ahead of the Punjab Assembly elections had
   led to a major political controversy.

   According to the suspension order, a report dated October 18, 2023 on
   the incident was submitted by the Director General of Police (DGP) in
   which the state police chief said that Singh did not perform his duty
   properly.

   After consideration of the matter at the level of the competent
   authority, the officer concerned is suspended with immediate effect,
   said the order issued in Punjabi.

   A Supreme Court-appointed committee that probed the security breach had
   earlier indicted several state officers for lapses.

   The top court had on January 12 last year appointed the committee to
   probe the breach, saying these questions cannot be left to 'one-sided
   inquiries' as they needed 'judicially trained independent minds' to
   investigate.
