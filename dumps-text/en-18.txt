Details

   The aim of Prevent is to stop people from becoming terrorists or
   supporting terrorism.

   The objectives of Prevent are to:
     * tackle the ideological causes of terrorism
     * intervene early to support people susceptible to radicalisation
     * enable people who have already engaged in terrorism to disengage
       and rehabilitate

   This is statutory guidance for England and Wales, issued on 7 September
   2023 under [46]Section 29 of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act
   2015. Subject to Parliamentary approval, it comes into force on 31
   December 2023.

   There is separate [47]guidance for Scotland.

   This statutory guidance is intended for use by:
     * senior leadership teams in any of the specified authorities listed
       in Part 1 of Schedule 6 of the CTSA 2015
     * those with dedicated Prevent and/or safeguarding responsibilities
     * people in specified authorities with responsibility for how
       resources and funding are used, and for external partnerships
     * those in a frontline role and likely to engage with people who may
       be susceptible to radicalisation

   This guidance may also inform best practice for other sectors that are
   not specified authorities but may wish to consider how to prevent the
   risk of people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism.

   The list of specified authorities subject to the duty at section 26
   CTSA 2015 can be found at Part 1 of [48]Schedule 6 of the CTSA 2015.
   Further details are in the sector specific sections of this guidance.

   This guidance replaces the:
     * Revised Prevent duty guidance: for England and Wales (2015)
     * Prevent duty guidance: for further education institutions in
       England and Wales (2015)
     * Prevent duty guidance: for higher education institutions in England
       and Wales 2015 (updated in April 2021)

   Specified authorities in England and Wales must continue to have regard
   to the [49]2015 guidance until the new guidance comes into force.
