   UNDERSTANDING THE WTO: THE AGREEMENTS

Anti-dumping, subsidies, safeguards: contingencies, etc

   Binding tariffs, and applying them equally to all trading partners
   (most-favoured-nation treatment, or MFN) are key to the smooth flow of
   trade in goods. The WTO agreements uphold the principles, but they also
   allow exceptions in some circumstances. Three of these issues are:

   [redbulle.gif] actions taken against dumping (selling at an unfairly
   low price)
   [redbulle.gif] subsidies and special countervailing duties to offset
   the subsidies
   [redbulle.gif] emergency measures to limit imports temporarily,
   designed to safeguard domestic industries.

Anti-dumping actions

   If a company exports a product at a price lower than the price it
   normally charges on its own home market, it is said to be dumping the
   product. Is this unfair competition? Opinions differ, but many
   governments take action against dumping in order to defend their
   domestic industries. The WTO agreement does not pass judgement. Its
   focus is on how governments can or cannot react to dumping it
   disciplines anti-dumping actions, and it is often called the
   Anti-Dumping Agreement. (This focus only on the reaction to dumping
   contrasts with the approach of the Subsidies and Countervailing
   Measures Agreement.)

   The legal definitions are more precise, but broadly speaking the WTO
   agreement allows governments to act against dumping where there is
   genuine (material) injury to the competing domestic industry. In order
   to do that the government has to be able to show that dumping is taking
   place, calculate the extent of dumping (how much lower the export price
   is compared to the exporters home market price), and show that the
   dumping is causing injury or threatening to do so.

   GATT (Article 6) allows countries to take action against dumping. The
   Anti-Dumping Agreement clarifies and expands Article 6, and the two
   operate together. They allow countries to act in a way that would
   normally break the GATT principles of [21]binding a tariff and [22]not
   discriminating between trading partners typically anti-dumping action
   means charging extra import duty on the particular product from the
   particular exporting country in order to bring its price closer to the
   normal value or to remove the injury to domestic industry in the
   importing country.

   There are many different ways of calculating whether a particular
   product is being dumped heavily or only lightly. The agreement narrows
   down the range of possible options. It provides three methods to
   calculate a products normal value. The main one is based on the price
   in the exporters domestic market. When this cannot be used, two
   alternatives are available the price charged by the exporter in another
   country, or a calculation based on the combination of the exporters
   production costs, other expenses and normal profit margins. And the
   agreement also specifies how a fair comparison can be made between the
   export price and what would be a normal price.

   Calculating the extent of dumping on a product is not enough.
   Anti-dumping measures can only be applied if the dumping is hurting the
   industry in the importing country. Therefore, a detailed investigation
   has to be conducted according to specified rules first. The
   investigation must evaluate all relevant economic factors that have a
   bearing on the state of the industry in question. If the investigation
   shows dumping is taking place and domestic industry is being hurt, the
   exporting company can undertake to raise its price to an agreed level
   in order to avoid anti-dumping import duty.

   Detailed procedures are set out on how anti-dumping cases are to be
   initiated, how the investigations are to be conducted, and the
   conditions for ensuring that all interested parties are given an
   opportunity to present evidence. Anti-dumping measures must expire five
   years after the date of imposition, unless an investigation shows that
   ending the measure would lead to injury.

   Anti-dumping investigations are to end immediately in cases where the
   authorities determine that the margin of dumping is insignificantly
   small (defined as less than 2% of the export price of the product).
   Other conditions are also set. For example, the investigations also
   have to end if the volume of dumped imports is negligible (i.e. if the
   volume from one country is less than 3% of total imports of that
   product although investigations can proceed if several countries, each
   supplying less than 3% of the imports, together account for 7% or more
   of total imports).

   The agreement says member countries must inform the Committee on
   Anti-Dumping Practices about all preliminary and final anti-dumping
   actions, promptly and in detail. They must also report on all
   investigations twice a year. When differences arise, members are
   encouraged to consult each other. They can also use the WTOs dispute
   settlement procedure.

   Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994

Subsidies and countervailing measures

   This agreement does two things: it disciplines the use of subsidies,
   and it regulates the actions countries can take to counter the effects
   of subsidies. It says a country can use the WTOs [29]dispute settlement
   procedure to seek the withdrawal of the subsidy or the removal of its
   adverse effects. Or the country can launch its own investigation and
   ultimately charge extra duty (known as countervailing duty) on
   subsidized imports that are found to be hurting domestic producers.

   The agreement contains a definition of subsidy. It also introduces the
   concept of a specific subsidy i.e. a subsidy available only to an
   enterprise, industry, group of enterprises, or group of industries in
   the country (or state, etc) that gives the subsidy. The disciplines set
   out in the agreement only apply to specific subsidies. They can be
   domestic or export subsidies.

   The agreement defines two categories of subsidies: prohibited and
   actionable. It originally contained a third category: non-actionable
   subsidies. This category existed for five years, ending on 31 December
   1999, and was not extended. The agreement applies to agricultural goods
   as well as industrial products, except when the subsidies are exempt
   under the Agriculture Agreements peace clause, due to expire at the end
   of 2003.

   [redbulle.gif] Prohibited subsidies: subsidies that require recipients
   to meet certain export targets, or to use domestic goods instead of
   imported goods. They are prohibited because they are specifically
   designed to distort international trade, and are therefore likely to
   hurt other countries trade. They can be challenged in the WTO dispute
   settlement procedure where they are handled under an accelerated
   timetable. If the dispute settlement procedure confirms that the
   subsidy is prohibited, it must be withdrawn immediately. Otherwise, the
   complaining country can take counter measures. If domestic producers
   are hurt by imports of subsidized products, countervailing duty can be
   imposed.

   [redbulle.gif] Actionable subsidies: in this category the complaining
   country has to show that the subsidy has an adverse effect on its
   interests. Otherwise the subsidy is permitted. The agreement defines
   three types of damage they can cause. One countrys subsidies can hurt a
   domestic industry in an importing country. They can hurt rival
   exporters from another country when the two compete in third markets.
   And domestic subsidies in one country can hurt exporters trying to
   compete in the subsidizing countrys domestic market. If the Dispute
   Settlement Body rules that the subsidy does have an adverse effect, the
   subsidy must be withdrawn or its adverse effect must be removed. Again,
   if domestic producers are hurt by imports of subsidized products,
   countervailing duty can be imposed.

   Some of the disciplines are similar to those of the Anti-Dumping
   Agreement. Countervailing duty (the parallel of anti-dumping duty) can
   only be charged after the importing country has conducted a detailed
   investigation similar to that required for anti-dumping action. There
   are detailed rules for deciding whether a product is being subsidized
   (not always an easy calculation), criteria for determining whether
   imports of subsidized products are hurting (causing injury to) domestic
   industry, procedures for initiating and conducting investigations, and
   rules on the implementation and duration (normally five years) of
   countervailing measures. The subsidized exporter can also agree to
   raise its export prices as an alternative to its exports being charged
   countervailing duty.

   Subsidies may play an important role in developing countries and in the
   transformation of centrally-planned economies to market economies.
   Least-developed countries and developing countries with less than
   $1,000 per capita GNP are exempted from disciplines on prohibited
   export subsidies. Other developing countries are given until 2003 to
   get rid of their export subsidies. Least-developed countries must
   eliminate import-substitution subsidies (i.e. subsidies designed to
   help domestic production and avoid importing) by 2003 for other
   developing countries the deadline was 2000. Developing countries also
   receive preferential treatment if their exports are subject to
   countervailing duty investigations. For transition economies,
   prohibited subsidies had to be phased out by 2002.

Safeguards: emergency protection from imports

   A WTO member may restrict imports of a product temporarily (take
   safeguard actions) if its domestic industry is injured or threatened
   with injury caused by a surge in imports. Here, the injury has to be
   serious. Safeguard measures were always available under GATT (Article
   19). However, they were infrequently used, some governments preferring
   to protect their domestic industries through grey area measures using
   bilateral negotiations outside GATTs auspices, they persuaded exporting
   countries to restrain exports voluntarily or to agree to other means of
   sharing markets. Agreements of this kind were reached for a wide range
   of products: automobiles, steel, and semiconductors, for example.

   The WTO agreement broke new ground. It prohibits grey-area measures,
   and it sets time limits (a sunset clause) on all safeguard actions. The
   agreement says members must not seek, take or maintain any voluntary
   export restraints, orderly marketing arrangements or any other similar
   measures on the export or the import side. The bilateral measures that
   were not modified to conform with the agreement were phased out at the
   end of 1998. Countries were allowed to keep one of these measures an
   extra year (until the end of 1999), but only the European Union for
   restrictions on imports of cars from Japan made use of this provision.

   An import surge justifying safeguard action can be a real increase in
   imports (an absolute increase); or it can be an increase in the imports
   share of a shrinking market, even if the import quantity has not
   increased (relative increase).

   Industries or companies may request safeguard action by their
   government. The WTO agreement sets out requirements for safeguard
   investigations by national authorities. The emphasis is on transparency
   and on following established rules and practices avoiding arbitrary
   methods. The authorities conducting investigations have to announce
   publicly when hearings are to take place and provide other appropriate
   means for interested parties to present evidence. The evidence must
   include arguments on whether a measure is in the public interest.

   The agreement sets out criteria for assessing whether serious injury is
   being caused or threatened, and the factors which must be considered in
   determining the impact of imports on the domestic industry. When
   imposed, a safeguard measure should be applied only to the extent
   necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to help the industry
   concerned to adjust. Where quantitative restrictions (quotas) are
   imposed, they normally should not reduce the quantities of imports
   below the annual average for the last three representative years for
   which statistics are available, unless clear justification is given
   that a different level is necessary to prevent or remedy serious
   injury.

   In principle, safeguard measures cannot be targeted at imports from a
   particular country. However, the agreement does describe how quotas can
   be allocated among supplying countries, including in the exceptional
   circumstance where imports from certain countries have increased
   disproportionately quickly. A safeguard measure should not last more
   than four years, although this can be extended up to eight years,
   subject to a determination by competent national authorities that the
   measure is needed and that there is evidence the industry is adjusting.
   Measures imposed for more than a year must be progressively
   liberalized.

   When a country restricts imports in order to safeguard its domestic
   producers, in principle it must give something in return. The agreement
   says the exporting country (or exporting countries) can seek
   compensation through consultations. If no agreement is reached the
   exporting country can retaliate by taking equivalent action for
   instance, it can raise tariffs on exports from the country that is
   enforcing the safeguard measure. In some circumstances, the exporting
   country has to wait for three years after the safeguard measure was
   introduced before it can retaliate in this way i.e. if the measure
   conforms with the provisions of the agreement and if it is taken as a
   result of an increase in the quantity of imports from the exporting
   country.

   To some extent developing countries exports are shielded from safeguard
   actions. An importing country can only apply a safeguard measure to a
   product from a developing country if the developing country is
   supplying more than 3% of the imports of that product, or if developing
   country members with less than 3% import share collectively account for
   more than 9% of total imports of the product concerned.

   The WTOs Safeguards Committee oversees the operation of the agreement
   and is responsible for the surveillance of members commitments.
   Governments have to report each phase of a safeguard investigation and
   related decision-making, and the committee reviews these reports.

   [34]Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures

   AD-CVD?

   People sometimes refer to the two together AD-CVD but there are
   fundamental differences

   Dumping and subsidies together with anti-dumping (AD) measures and
   countervailing duties (CVD) share a number of similarities. Many
   countries handle the two under a single law, apply a similar process to
   deal with them and give a single authority responsibility for
   investigations. Occasionally, the two WTO committees responsible for
   these issues meet jointly.

   The reaction to dumping and subsidies is often a special offsetting
   import tax (countervailing duty in the case of a subsidy). This is
   charged on products from specific countries and therefore it breaks the
   GATT principles of [35]binding a tariff and treating trading partners
   equally ([36]MFN). The agreements provide an escape clause, but they
   both also say that before imposing a duty, the importing country must
   conduct a detailed investigation that shows properly that domestic
   industry is hurt.

   But there are also fundamental differences, and these are reflected in
   the agreements.

   Dumping is an action by a company. With subsidies, it is the government
   or a government agency that acts, either by paying out subsidies
   directly or by requiring companies to subsidize certain customers.

   But the WTO is an organization of countries and their governments. The
   WTO does not deal with companies and cannot regulate companies actions
   such as dumping. Therefore the Anti-Dumping Agreement only concerns the
   actions governments may take against dumping. With subsidies,
   governments act on both sides: they subsidize and they act against each
   others subsidies. Therefore the subsidies agreement disciplines both
   the subsidies and the reactions.
