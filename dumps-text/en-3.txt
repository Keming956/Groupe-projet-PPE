Manner of acquisitions

   Examples of property acquisition in which ad valorem stamp duty (i.e.
   BSD, ABSD and SSD, whichever applicable) is payable:
    1. By way of purchase e.g. acceptance to option to purchase, sale and
       purchase agreement
    2. By way of gift including a voluntary declaration of trust and
       settlement
          + Declaration of Trust / Trust Deed:
               o A fixed duty of $10 is payable on the Declaration of
                 Trust/Trust deed which does not result in a change in
                 beneficial interest in the property.
               o Where there is a change in beneficial interest in the
                 property, ad valorem stamp duty will be payable on the
                 Declaration of Trust / Trust Deed.
    3. By way of distribution in specie upon the winding up of a company*
    4. By way of distribution from the estate of a deceased that is not in
       accordance to the Will, Intestate Succession Act or Muslim Law of
       Inheritance.
    5. By way of resulting trust pursuant to a renunciation of interest in
       residential property held under a bare trust

   *ABSD is applicable on transfer of interest in a residential property
   on or after 13 Oct 2023 which is distributed in specie to a shareholder
   of a company in connection with a liquidation of the company.
   [645]

Renunciation of interest in trust over residential property by beneficial
owner (Section 22C)

   Where any beneficiary renounces his interest in a residential property
   that is transferred to be held on bare trust on or after 10 May 2022,
   the settlor will need to pay stamp duty i.e. BSD and ABSD on the
   transfer of the share of the residential property back to him, under
   Section 22C of the Stamp Duties Act.
   You can refer to [646]Renunciation of Interest in Trust over
   residential property by Beneficial Owner (Section 22C) for more
   information.
   Example: A settlor sets up a trust where a residential property is held
   on bare trust for a sole identifiable beneficiary. The beneficiary
   later renounces his interest in the property, and a resulting trust is
   formed in favour of the settlor. The settlor is required to pay BSD and
   ABSD (based on the settlor’s profile) on the transfer of the
   residential property back to him.

Requirement to pay BSD

   You are required to pay BSD for documents executed for the transfer or
   sale and purchase of property located in Singapore. BSD will
   be computed on the purchase price as stated in the document to be
   stamped or market value of the property (whichever is the higher
   amount).

   If there is a benefit associated with the acquisition, and the benefit
   is stated in the document to be stamped and is a cash discount (i.e.
   cash, non-post dated cashier's order or cheque) to be given to the
   purchaser upon execution of the document (and not later), the amount of
   discount may be deducted from the purchase price to determine the
   consideration for stamp duty purpose. This is provided that the nett
   price is still reflective of market value.

   If the document to be stamped stated a non-cash benefit to be given
   (e.g. furniture voucher, rental guarantee, car or lucky draw), the
   value of benefit is not deductible from the purchase price for stamp
   duty purpose.

   If the cash or non- cash benefit is not stated in the document to be
   stamped, the value of the benefit is also not deductible from the
   purchase price for stamp duty purpose.

   The first instrument executed relating to a sale and purchase is liable
   to ad valorem duty (i.e. full duty). Subsequent document(s) relating to
   the same sale transaction are not liable to stamp duty.

Acquisition of property through an en-bloc purchase or “block” purchase

   Where multiple properties are acquired collectively, stamp duty will be
   calculated on the total purchase price of the multiple properties if:
    1. There is a single contract for the purchase of the multiple
       properties; or
    2. The purchases of the multiple properties are dependent and
       conditional on one another.

Stamp duty on a single contract for multiple properties

   Where there is a single contract for the purchase of multiple
   properties followed by individual documents for the purchase of each
   property, the single contract should be stamped at ad valorem duty
   based on the total purchase price.

Stamp duty on multiple documents

   Where there are multiple documents (with purchases which are dependent
   and conditional on one another), only one of the documents is required
   to be stamped at ad valorem duty, based on the total purchase price of
   all the related properties.

Rates and computation

   BSD^ is computed based on the purchase price or market value of the
   property, whichever is higher.

   Prior to 20 Feb 2018, the BSD rate was up to 3%. With effect from 20
   Feb 2018, there are differentiated BSD rates between residential and
   non-residential properties. The BSD rate for acquisition of residential
   properties from 20 Feb 2018 to 14 Feb 2023 is up to 4%. From 15 Feb
   2023, the top marginal rate for residential properties is 6%, and the
   top marginal rate for non-residential properties is 5%.

   For definition of residential or non-residential properties,
   click [647]here.

   The BSD rates are as follows:
   On or after 15 Feb 2023
   Purchase price or market value of the property BSD rates for
   residential properties BSD rates for non-residential properties
   First $180,000 1% 1%
   Next $180,000 2% 2%
   Next $640,000 3% 3%
   Next $500,000 4% 4%
   Next $1,500,000 5% 5%
   Remaining amount 6%
   ^BSD is rounded down to the nearest dollar, subject to a minimum duty
   of $1.

Examples

   Example 1: A terrace house was purchased on 17 Feb 2023 at $4,500,100
   which is reflective of the market value
    Market Value of the Property BSD Rate   Calculation
    First $180,000 1%   = $1,800 (1% x $180,000)
    Next $180,000   2%  = $3,600 (2% x $180,000)
    Next $640,000  3%  = $19,200 (3% x $640,000)
   Next $500,000 4% =  $20,000 (4% x $500,000)
   Next $1,500,000 5% = $75,000 (5% x $1,500,000)
   Remaining $1,500,100  6%  = $90,006 (6% x $1,500,100)
    BSD Payable    = $209,606 ($1,800 + $3,600 + $19,200 + $20,000 +
   $75,000 + $90,006)

   Example 2: A vacant land zoned “Commercial and Residential” was
   purchased on 1 Mar 2023 at $22,000,000 which is reflective of the
   market value

   Since the land is zoned “Commercial and Residential”, 60% and 40% of
   the gross floor area of the property is deemed attributable for
   residential and non-residential purposes respectively. BSD rates for
   residential and non-residential properties apply on the respective
   component.

   Value of 60% of the GFA deemed attributable for residential purposes =
   $9,000,000*

   Value of 40% of the GFA deemed attributable for commercial purposes =
   $13,000,000*

   *Valued and determined by a professional valuer.

   The BSD payable is:
   Market value of the Property BSD rate Calculation
   For the residential component
   First $180,000 1% = $1,800 (1% x $180,000)
   Next $180,000 2% = $3,600 (2% x $180,000)
   Next $640,000 3% = $19,200 (3% x $640,000)
   Next $500,000 4% = $20,000 (4% x $500,000)
   Next $1,500,000 5% = $75,000 (5% x $1,500,000)
   Remaining $6,000,000 6% = $360,000 (6% x $6,000,000)
   BSD for the residential component = $479,600 ($1,800 + $3,600 + $19,200
   + $20,000 + $75,000 + $360,000)
   For the non-residential component
   First $180,000 1% = $1,800 (1% x $180,000)
   Next $180,000 2% = $3,600 (2% x $180,000)
   Next $640,000 3% = $19,200 (3% x $640,000)
   Next $500,000 4% = $20,000 (4% x $500,000)
   Remaining $11,500,000 5% = $575,000 (5% x $11,500,000)
   BSD for the non-residential component = $619,600 ($1,800 + $3,600 +
   $19,200 + $20,000 + $575,000)
   BSD payable = $1,099,200 ($497,600 + $619,600)

Remissions

Acquisition of residential land for non-residential development

   Acquisition of residential land (i.e. vacant land or entire building
   with land zoned “Residential”, “Residential/ Institution”, “White”,
   “Commercial & Residential” or “Residential with Commercial at 1st
   storey”) may qualify for upfront BSD remission (by way of the
   difference of the BSD rates for residential and non-residential
   properties) if the remission conditions are met.

A. BSD remission for acquisition of residential land with use restriction

   This is a BSD remission for acquisition of residential land that is
   restricted^1 from residential use/ development (e.g. where the entire
   site or part of the site must be developed for non-residential
   purposes). If remission is granted, the BSD rates for non-residential
   properties would apply on the entire site or the part of the site
   restricted from residential use/development.

   The BSD remission may be considered, subject to the following
   conditions:
    1. X%^2 of the gross floor area (“GFA”) of the subject property (as
       the case may be) must be developed/ used for non-residential
       purposes;
    2. Not to develop and/ or use X% of GFA of the subject property for
       residential purposes;
    3. Notify the IRAS immediately should any of the X% of GFA of the
       subject property be subsequently developed and/ or used for
       residential purposes;
    4. Submit the following documents to IRAS within 14 days from the date
       of the acquisition:
         1. Technical Condition of Tender for the Government Land Sales
            site;
         2. Written Permission (“WP”) issued by URA for the redevelopment;
            or
         3. Any other documents or information that the Commissioner of
            Stamp Duties (“COSD”) may require in relation to the
            undertaking;
    5. Pay to the COSD as a debt due to the Singapore Government an amount
       equal to the BSD remitted with immediate effect from the earlier of
       the following:

FAQS

   [649]

I am a Singapore Citizen buying my first property. Do I need to pay BSD?

   Yes, your purchase is subject to BSD. BSD is payable on all
   acquisitions of immovable properties in Singapore. It is not dependent
   on the nationality of the buyer or the number of properties that the
   buyer owns.
   [650]

I am buying an HDB flat. Do I need to pay BSD?

   Yes, BSD is payable upon the acquisition of any immovable property or
   land in Singapore, regardless of whether it is a private property or an
   HDB flat.
   [651]

I am buying an HDB shop with living quarters. Is my purchase subject to BSD
rates for non-residential property?

   No, as this is a property where one of the permitted uses is for
   residential use, the BSD rates for residential and non-residential
   properties would apply on the value attributable to the respective
   components.
   [652]

I am buying a semi-detached house with land zoned “Residential”. The
semi-detached house has been approved as a child care centre. Is my purchase
subject to BSD rates for non-residential property?

   No, as this is an acquisition of the building and land, the applicable
   BSD rates would depend on the zoning of the land. Since the land is
   zoned “Residential”, BSD rates for residential property applies.
   [653]

I am buying the upper floors of a shophouse which have been approved as a
child care centre for 3 years. Upon expiry of the approval, the use will
automatically revert to residential use. Is my purchase subject to BSD rates
for non-residential property?

   No, the BSD rates for residential properties will apply as this is a
   residential property and the use as a child care centre is only a
   temporary permitted use.
   [654]

I am buying the upper floors of a shophouse which have been permitted for
restaurant use by a Written Permission given under section 14(4) of the
Planning Act for a period exceeding 10 years. Is my purchase subject to BSD
rates for non-residential property?

   Yes, the BSD rates for non-residential property will apply since the
   properties acquired are permitted for non-residential use.
   [655]

I am buying a land zoned “Commercial & Residential”. What is the market value
attributable to the residential and non-residential component?

   For a land zoned “Commercial & Residential”, 60% GFA of the land is
   deemed attributable for residential purpose and the remainder is deemed
   attributable for non-residential purpose. You may get a professional
   valuer to value the part of the property attributable to residential
   and non-residential purposes.
   [656]

Can the contracting parties change the date of instrument to avoid paying
higher duty?

   No. The Commissioner of Stamp Duties takes a serious view of any
   attempt to evade or reduce the incidence of duties. Evasion of duties
   is an offence under section 62 of the Stamp Duties Act. Any person
   guilty of such an offence shall be liable on conviction to a fine of up
   to $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term of up to 3 years or to both.
   The Commissioner of Stamp Duties may also disregard or vary any
   arrangements meant to evade or reduce the incidence of duty, and impose
   the duty (including late stamping penalties, if applicable) which would
   otherwise be payable.
   [657]

Can I pay BSD using my Central Provident Fund (CPF) money?

   Using CPF funds to pay stamp duty is subject to the terms and
   conditions under the Private Properties and Public Housing Schemes. You
   may wish to check with CPF Board for more details.
   [658]

Do I need to pay the ABSD if I have paid the BSD?

   ABSD remains payable in addition to the BSD by buyers of certain
   profiles. For more information on ABSD, please refer to our webpage
   on [659]ABSD.
   [660]

I executed a contract to acquire a land zoned “White”. Its allowable use
includes residential but I would like to develop a 100% non-residential
development instead. Is the BSD payable calculated based on the BSD rates for
non-residential properties?

   As 100% GFA of the land is deemed attributable for residential purpose,
   the BSD payable would be calculated using the BSD rates for residential
   properties on the full purchase price or market value, whichever the
   higher. The BSD has to be paid within 14 days from the date of
   execution of the instrument.

   However, since you are constructing a 100% non-residential development,
   remission may be applicable. Please refer to part B of the remission
   section mentioned above, i.e. BSD remission for acquisition of
   residential land without use restriction for 100% non-residential
   development.
