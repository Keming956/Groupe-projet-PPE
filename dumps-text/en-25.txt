   r-2023

Who is likely to be affected

   Manufacturers, importers, distributors, retailers and consumers of
   tobacco products. Tobacco products include cigarettes, cigars,
   hand-rolling tobacco, other smoking tobacco and chewing tobacco,
   tobacco for heating and herbal smoking products.

General description of the measure

   This measure sets out how tobacco duties will increase on 22 November
   2023.

Policy objective

   The government is committed to maintaining high tobacco duty rates.
   This is an established tool to reduce smoking prevalence and ensure
   that tobacco duties continue to contribute to government revenues.

   The ‘tobacco duty escalator’, which increases duty in line with the
   Retail Price Index (RPI) +2% at each Budget, was extended at Budget
   2020 until the end of the current Parliament. In addition, increasing
   the duty rate on hand-rolling tobacco above the duty escalator will
   narrow the gap between hand-rolling tobacco and cigarette duty rates.

Background to the measure

   As announced at Autumn Statement 2023, the duty rate on all tobacco
   products will increase by the tobacco duty escalator of 2% above RPI
   inflation. The duty rate for hand-rolling tobacco will rise by an
   additional 10%, to 12% above RPI inflation. These changes will apply
   from 6pm on 22 November 2023.

Detailed proposal

Operative date

   The new tobacco duty rates will have effect from 6pm on 22 November
   2023.

Current law

   The table of duty rates on tobacco products is in Schedule 1 to the
   Tobacco Products Duty Act 1979 (TPDA).

Proposed revisions

   Legislation will be introduced in Autumn Finance Bill 2023 to increase
   the rates of duty on tobacco products. The legislation will amend
   Schedule 1 to the TPDA and makes consequential changes to the
   simplified calculations contained within the Travellers’ Allowances
   Order 1994.

Summary of impacts

Exchequer impact (£ million)

   2023 to 2024 2024 to 2025 2025 to 2026 2026 to 2027 2027 to 2028 2028
   to 2029
   +40 +85 +90 +95 +100 +100

   These figures are set out in table 5.1 of Autumn Statement 2023 and
   have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility. More
   details can be found in the policy costings document published
   alongside Autumn Statement 2023.

Economic impact

   This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic
   impacts.

Impact on individuals, households and families

   This measure will impact on individuals who smoke by increasing the
   price of tobacco products. Heavy smokers will face the highest burden
   from this measure.

   In response to higher prices, some individuals could choose to consume
   less, some could down-trade from more expensive to cheaper tobacco
   products and others could engage in cross-border shopping or purchase
   from the illicit tobacco market. HMRC will monitor and respond to any
   potential shift in illicit consumption as part of its strategy to
   combat tobacco fraud.

   Customer experience is expected to stay broadly the same as this
   measure only increases the price of tobacco products.

   The measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability,
   or breakdown.

Equalities impacts

   Due to differences in tobacco consumption, any change to tobacco duties
   will have equalities impacts. Men (14.6%)  are slightly more likely to
   smoke than women (11.2%).

   Younger people are also more likely to smoke than older people. People
   aged 25 to 34 years have the highest proportion of smokers (16.3%).
   Over 65s having the lowest proportion of smokers (8.3%).

Impact on business including civil society organisations

   This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on fewer than 30
   manufacturers and importers. They will face an increase in tobacco duty
   rates that they are likely to pass on to consumers.

   There will be a negligible one-off cost to these businesses of
   familiarisation and amending systems to reflect the new rates. It is
   not expected there will be any continuing costs.

   Customer experience is expected to stay broadly the same as this
   measure does not present a significant change for tobacco manufacturers
   and importers.

   There is no impact on civil society organisations.

Operational impact (£ million) (HMRC or other)

   HMRC will need to make changes to IT systems to deliver this change, at
   an estimated cost of £30,000.

Other impacts

   Health impact assessment: any reduction in smoking prevalence will have
   a positive impact on health and reduce the cost to the NHS of
   smoking-related illness. There may be reductions in other costs that
   arise from tobacco use.

   These costs include losses in productivity from smoking breaks and
   ill-health absences, the cost of cleaning up cigarette butts, the cost
   of smoking-related house fires and the loss in economic output from
   people who die from diseases related to smoking or exposure to
   second-hand smoke.

   Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified.

Monitoring and evaluation

   The measure will be monitored through information collected from tax
   receipts.
