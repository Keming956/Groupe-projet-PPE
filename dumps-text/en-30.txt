Stamp duty when buying a vehicle

   Calculate how much stamp duty you'll pay if you are buying a new or
   used vehicle. Exemptions apply to eligible pensioners and some vehicle
   types.
   On this page

What is stamp duty?

   Stamp duty is charged when registration is issued to a different person
   or corporation. The tax is collected by Transport for NSW on behalf of
   Revenue NSW.

   To calculate stamp duty, you need the vehicle's market value or how
   much you paid for it (whichever is higher).

     __________________________________________________________________

       trailer
     * an [76]eligible DVA pensioner
     * registering a new heavy trailer with a Gross Vehicle Mass of more
