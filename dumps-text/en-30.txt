What is stamp duty?

   Stamp duty is charged when registration is issued to a different person
   or corporation. The tax is collected by Transport for NSW on behalf of
   Revenue NSW.

   To calculate stamp duty, you need the vehicle's market value or how
   much you paid for it (whichever is higher).
