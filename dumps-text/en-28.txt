Who is likely to be affected

   Recognised growth markets, persons purchasing UK securities traded on
   recognised growth markets and companies seeking to admit their shares
   to trading on recognised growth markets.

General description of the measure

   This measure increases access to the growth market exemption, which
   relieves trades made on a ‘recognised growth market’ from Stamp Duty
   and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (collectively, Stamp Taxes on Shares). The
   measure allows those Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulated
   multilateral trading facilities (MTFs), run by investment firms, that
   are approved as ‘recognised growth markets’ by HMRC to access the
   growth market exemption without needing to be recognised stock
   exchanges.

   This measure updates the market capitalisation condition for qualifying
   as a recognised growth market for the purposes of the exemption, by
   increasing the level up to which a majority of companies listed on the
   exchange can be capitalised from £170 million to £450 million.

Policy objective

   This measure seeks to ensure fairness in the current application of the
   growth market exemption, increase competition in the market leading to
   greater choice for small and medium enterprises seeking to access
   finance and updates the conditions attached to the growth market
   exemption to reflect the modern market.

Background to the measure

   This measure was announced at Autumn Statement 2023 and will be
   legislated for in Autumn Finance Bill 2023.

Detailed proposal

Operative date

   This measure will have effect on and after 1 January 2024.

Current law

   Current law is contained in section 99A Finance Act 1986.

Proposed revisions

   Legislation will be introduced in Autumn Finance Bill 2023 to amend the
   conditions to qualify for recognition as a growth market in section 99A
   Finance Act 1986.

Summary of impacts

Exchequer impact (£ million)

   2023 to 2024 2024 to 2025 2025 to 2026 2026 to 2027 2027 to 2028 2028
   to 2029
   Negligible Negligible Negligible Negligible Negligible Negligible

   This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on the Exchequer.

Economic impact

   This measure is not expected to have any significant economic impacts.

Impact on individuals, households and families

   This measure will impact on any individuals that purchase securities on
   any MTF run by an investment firm that applies, qualifies for and is
   approved for the growth market exemption by removing the 0.5% cost of
   Stamp Taxes on Shares per securities transaction. Individuals will not
   need to do anything as the exemption is automatically applied when the
   purchase is made.

   This measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability
   or breakdown.

   Customer experience is expected to remain broadly the same as the
   change does not affect any current processes or tax admin obligations
   for individuals.

Equalities impacts

   It is not anticipated that there will be impacts on those in groups
   sharing protected characteristics.

Impact on business including civil society organisations

   This measure is not expected to impact businesses or civil society
   organisations as it is anticipated that businesses who decide where to
   list their shares for trading, would consider the various benefits or
   the various markets that they could qualify for (for example, one of
   those factors might be whether the market offers the growth market
   exemption). It is expected that markets would advertise this rather
   than businesses having to find out for themselves via this measure,
   given it would be one of their selling points to get businesses to list
   with them rather than competitor markets.

   The increase in companies market capitalisation level should allow
   companies that are over the previous £170 million but under the new
   level more choice in terms of whether they position themselves on a
   recognised growth market and access the growth market exemption or
   whether they look to list on a main market and opt for the benefits
   that come with that.

   This measure is expected overall to have no impact on business’
   experience of dealing with HMRC, as the change does not change any
   processes or tax admin obligations.

   This measure is not expected to impact civil society organisations.

Operational impact (£ million) (HMRC or other)

   There is no operational impact for HMRC. Systems to approve
   applications for recognised growth market status are already in place
   and we do not expect high numbers of additional applications. The
   current arrangements for recognised growth market compliance will
   continue to apply.

Other impacts

   Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified.

Monitoring and evaluation

   This measure will be monitored using existing processes for the growth
   market exemption.
