What Is a Duty?

   The term "duty" refers to a form of taxation levied on certain goods,
   services, or other transactions. People and [157]corporations may be
   required to pay levies on [158]imports and exports by governments in
   the form of customs duties and other taxes. This is done in order to
   collect revenue and to satisfy other economic reasons. Duties are
   enforceable by law and may be imposed on [159]commodities or financial
   [160]transactions instead of individuals.

   The term also refers to the responsibilities held by an individual,
   especially someone in a position of power.

Key Takeaways

     * A duty is a form of taxation levied on certain goods, services, or
       other transactions that are imported and exported.
     * Duty rates are a percentage determined by the total value of the
       goods paid for in another country.
     * Duties provide a form of commerce protection for jobs, the economy,
       the environment, and other interests by controlling the influx and
       outflow of merchandise.
     * A duty may also be someone's moral or fiduciary responsibility.

Understanding a Duty

   Governments impose taxes on individuals and companies that make or
   receive shipments internationally. These levies must be paid before
   [161]delivery can be made. These levies are called customs or
   [162]import duties. These are [163]tariffs or taxes imposed on goods
   transported across international borders.

   Customs duty rates are a percentage determined by the total value of
   the goods paid for in another country. The quality, size, or weight of
   the product are not determining factors. The Harmonized Tariff System
   of the United States is used domestically as a reference for applicable
   tariffs on merchandise imported to the country.

   The intent of this form of duty is to provide a form of [164]commerce
   protection for each country's jobs, [165]economy, environment, and
   other interests by controlling the influx and outflow of merchandise.
   Duties may be imposed on restrictive and prohibited goods that are
   shipped in and out of a country. The imposition and collection of
   duties also help contribute to a nation's revenue pool.

Duties When Traveling

   This form of duty can be revoked in certain situations such as an
   airport's [166]duty-free shop. When customers patronize a duty-free
   shop, commodities that are usually taxed such as cigarettes and alcohol
   will not have a duty levied on them. Foreign visitors will then be able
   to purchase the goods at a lower [167]price compared to domestic
   citizens.

   There are limits and guidelines for shopping duty-free. The products
   purchased are intended to be taken out of the country where they were
   bought. Shoppers generally have to show their passports when making
   duty-free purchases.

   Travelers who make duty-free purchases may be required to declare to
   customs officials what they bought once they arrive back in their
   respective home countries. They may be required to show receipts for
   the purchases. Monetary limits on the value of duty-free purchases may
   be set. If the value exceeds the threshold, tariffs and local taxes may
   be imposed on the purchases.

   The U.S. Customs and Border Protection will outline the details
   regarding duties on a variety of products. Specific details are
   outlined for tobacco and alcoholic products as well as items being
   brought in from Cuba.﻿﻿

Special Considerations

   The term "duty" may also refer to any responsibilities—whether moral or
   otherwise—held by an individual. These are obligations that a
   person—especially someone in a position of authority—has to fulfill the
   responsibilities of their position.

   In a corporate context, this is a fiduciary responsibility that a
   company's [168]chief executive officer (CEO) has to the company's
   [169]shareholders. This means that any course of action the CEO takes
   should be in the best interests of the company's shareholders. For
   example, a CEO's duty can include weighing whether or not a merger deal
   with a rival would provide adequate [170]shareholder value.

   This responsibility is also similar to a [171]fiduciary duty. A
   fiduciary duty is when an individual places their trust and reliance on
   another in regards to a monetary situation. For example, a financial
   adviser would have a fiduciary duty to their clients and must act in
   the best interest of their clients. The same would hold true for an
   executor of an estate. The fiduciary has a duty to take responsibility
   and make decisions that will benefit the client above anyone else.
