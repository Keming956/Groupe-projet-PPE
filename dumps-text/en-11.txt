Sustainable procurement duty

   Sustainable public procurement aims to make the best use of public
   money, helping us to achieve our overarching purpose and strategic
   objectives.

   Scotland’s strong track record  of delivering sustainable procurement
   outcomes for the past 20 years, is demonstrated in our [40]Independent
   Review.

   The [41]sustainable procurement duty, outlined in Procurement Reform
   (Scotland) Act 2014, aligns with our purpose to create a more
   successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish,
   through increasing sustainable economic growth.

   It is underpinned by the [42]National Performance Framework and
   Scotland's Economic Strategy.

   The [43]sustainable procurement duty requires that before a contracting
   authority buys anything, it must think about how it can improve the
   social, environmental and economic wellbeing of the area in which it
   operates, with a particular focus on [44]reducing inequality.

   It also requires a contracting authority to consider how its
   procurement processes can [45]facilitate the involvement of SMEs, third
   sector bodies and supported businesses, and how public procurement can
   be used to promote innovation.

   The Sustainable Procurement Duty is referred to in the [46]Public
   Procurement Strategy for Scotland, and sustainable procurement is
   central to multiple of the strategic objectives. Prominent examples
   include:
     * whole life costing: the promotion of life-cycle approaches to
       establishing value for money in procurement assessment processes
     * food security: ensuring high standards of animal welfare,
       sustainable production and waste reduction through procurement
       processes to improve community health, wellbeing and education

   Compliance with the sustainable procurement duty is the mechanism
   through which public procurement contributes to and tracks its
   contribution to our overarching purpose.

   Each contracting authority must set out in its procurement strategy how
   it intends to comply with the duty, and must report annually on
   progress.

Sustainable procurement support and guidance

   Guidance has been published to help public bodies comply with the
   sustainable procurement duty and support sustainable procurement,
   including [47]statutory guidance on the sustainable procurement duty
   (chapter 3).

Sustainable procurement tools

   We have developed a range of tools to help public sector organisations
   identify and address how they can optimise the economic, social and
   environmental outcomes of their procurement activity.

   Prioritisation tool

   The prioritisation tool is designed to assist early stage strategic
   planning, and brings a standard, structured approach to the assessment
   of spend categories.

   Sustainability test

   The sustainability test is designed to help embed relevant and
   proportionate sustainability requirements in the development of
   frameworks and contracts.

   It can be used in isolation or by reference to the results of
   prioritisation assessment, where undertaken.

   Life cycle impact mapping (part of sustainability test)

   Life cycle impact mapping is used to identify and assess the social and
   environmental impacts of raw materials, manufacturing and logistics,
   use and disposal or end of life management.

   Every product and service has a 'life cycle' or number of stages it
   goes through:
     * from the extraction and sourcing of raw materials, such as mining
     * to the transportation of sub-assemblies and parts, often through a
       global supply chain
     * to the use of products or works and the delivery of services
     * to the re-use, recycling, remanufacture and final disposal of
       materials

Flexible framework assessment tool

   The flexible framework assessment tool is used to assess current level
   of performance and the actions required to embed good procurement
   practice to realise intended sustainable outcomes.

   Access the [48]sustainable procurement duty tools.

   A series of [49]sustainable procurement supporting guides are also
   available to help public sector organisations embed sustainability into
   their procurement processes.
