Overview

   The Equality Act 2010 legally protects people from discrimination in
   the workplace and in wider society.

   It replaced previous anti-discrimination laws with a single Act, making
   the law easier to understand and strengthening protection in some
   situations. It sets out the different ways in which it’s unlawful to
   treat someone.

   Find out more about who is protected from discrimination, the types of
   discrimination under the law and what action you can take if you feel
   you’ve been unfairly discriminated against.

Discrimination: making a complaint

   Before the Act came into force there were several pieces of legislation
   to cover discrimination, including:
     * Sex Discrimination Act 1975
     * Race Relations Act 1976
     * Disability Discrimination Act 1995

   If you wish to complain about possible unlawful treatment there are 2
   separate processes, depending on when it happened.

Complaints: before October 2010

   If you were subjected to unlawful treatment (eg discrimination,
   harassment or victimisation) before 1 October 2010, the Equality Act
   won’t apply. Instead, you’ll be covered by the legislation that was in
   force at the time.

   For example, if you experienced race discrimination on 30 September
   2010 and want to make a complaint or bring legal proceedings, the Race
   Relations Act 1976 will apply, not the Equality Act.

   This is also true of any legal proceedings. They will go ahead
   according to the legislation under which they were brought, even if
   they may have continued after 1 October 2010.
     * Questionnaires and guidance booklets for complaints under previous
       legislation

Complaints: after October 2010

   If you were subject to unlawful treatment on or after 1 October 2010,
   the Equality Act applies.

   For example, if you experienced sex discrimination on 30 September
   2010, which continued until 2 October 2010, the Equality Act will
   apply, not the Sex Discrimination Act.

   Find out more about how to complain about unlawful treatment in the
   Discrimination: your rights guide.

Equality Act provisions: commencement dates

   To allow people and organisations enough time to prepare for the new
   laws, the provisions of the Act were brought in at different times
   (known as commencement dates).

October 2010

   Equality Act provisions which came into force on 1 October 2010:
     * the basic framework of protection against direct and indirect
       discrimination, harassment and victimisation in services and public
       functions, premi, work, education, associations and transport
     * changing the definition of gender reassignment, by removing the
       requirement for medical supervision
     * providing protection for people discriminated against because they
       are perceived to have, or are associated with someone who has, a
       protected characteristic
     * clearer protection for breastfeeding mothers
     * applying a uniform definition of indirect discrimination to all
       protected characteristics
     * harmonising provisions allowing voluntary positive action

Provisions relating to disability

     * extending protection against indirect discrimination to disability
     * introducing the concept of “discrimination arising from disability”
       to replace protection under previous legislation lost as a result
       of a legal judgment
     * applying the detriment model to victimisation protection (aligning
       with the approach in employment law)
     * harmonising the thresholds for the duty to make reasonable
       adjustments for disabled people
     * extending protection against harassment of employees by third
       parties to all protected characteristics
     * making it more difficult for disabled people to be unfairly
       screened out when applying for jobs, by restricting the
       circumstances in which employers can ask job applicants questions
       about disability or health

Provisions relating to work

     * allowing claims for direct gender pay discrimination where there is
       no actual comparator
     * making pay secrecy clauses unenforceable
     * extending protection in private clubs to sex, religion or belief,
       pregnancy and maternity, and gender reassignment
     * introducing new powers for employment tribunals to make
       recommendations which benefit the wider workforce

April 2011

   Equality Act provisions which came into force in April 2011:
     * positive action - recruitment and promotion
     * public sector Equality Duty (see section below)

   Ministers are considering how to implement the remaining provisions in
   the best way for business and for others with rights and
   responsibilities under the act. Their decisions will be announced in
   due course.

   Equality Act Provisions that the government has decided not to take
   forward:
     * public sector duty regarding socio-economic inequalities
     * combined discrimination - dual characteristics

Age discrimination

   The Equality Act 2010 includes provisions that ban age discrimination
   against adults in the provision of services and public functions. The
   ban came into force on 1 October 2012 and it is now unlawful to
   discriminate on the basis of age unless:
     * the practice is covered by an exception from the ban
     * good reason can be shown for the differential treatment (‘objective
       justification’)

   The ban on age discrimination is designed to ensure that the new law
   prohibits only harmful treatment that results in genuinely unfair
   discrimination because of age. It does not outlaw the many instances of
   different treatment that are justifiable or beneficial.

   You can read the original consultation on the archived Government
   Equalities Office website.

   There is an overview of how the ban works and tailored guides for small
   businesses, private clubs and the holiday sector in the Equality Act
   guidance.

Age discrimination: exceptions

   The government response to the consultation includes the draft
   Exceptions Order. You can also read the impact assessment.

   Exceptions under the Order are:
     * age-based concessions
     * age-related holidays
     * age verification
     * clubs and associations concessions
     * financial services
     * immigration
     * residential park homes
     * sport

   These specific exceptions are in addition to:
     * general exceptions already allowed by the Act
     * positive action measures
     * ‘objective justification’

   There are no specific exceptions to the ban on age discrimination for
   health or social care services. This means that any age-based practices
   by the NHS and social care organisations need to be objectively
   justified, if challenged.

Public sector Equality Duty

   The public sector Equality Duty came into force across Great Britain on
   5 April 2011. It means that public bodies have to consider all
   individuals when carrying out their day-to-day work – in shaping
   policy, in delivering services and in relation to their own employees.

   It also requires that public bodies have due regard to the need to:
     * eliminate discrimination
     * advance equality of opportunity
     * foster good relations between different people when carrying out
       their activities

Who the Equality Duty applies to

   The Equality Duty applies across Great Britain to the public bodies
   listed in Schedule 19 (as amended), and to any other organisation when
   it is carrying out a public function.

Specific duties

   The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) Regulations 2011 came into
   force on 10 September 2011.

   The specific duties require public bodies to publish relevant,
   proportionate information showing compliance with the Equality Duty,
   and to set equality objectives.

Guidance for public bodies

   The Government Equalities Office has published 2 quick-start guides to
   help public bodies understand the Equality Duty and the specific
   duties:
     * Quick start guide: public sector Equality Duty
     * Quick start guide: Specific duties

   The Equality and Human Rights Commission is the statutory body
   established to help eliminate discrimination and reduce inequality. The
   Commission has published new non-statutory guidance on:
     * The essential guide to the public sector Equality Duty
     * Meeting the Equality Duty in policy and decision-making
     * Engagement and the Equality Duty
     * Equality objectives and the Equality Duty
     * Equality information and the Equality Duty
     * Technical guidance on the public sector Equality Duty - England

Devolution

   Section 153 of the act enables the Welsh and Scottish ministers to
   impose specific duties on certain Welsh and Scottish public bodies
   through secondary legislation. For Welsh and cross-border Welsh public
   bodies, specific duties have been finalised by the Welsh Assembly
   government and came into force on 6 April 2011.

   The Equality Act 2010 (Statutory Duties) (Wales) Regulations 2011

   For Scottish public bodies, the Scottish government launched a
   consultation on revised draft Regulations for specific duties on 9
   September 2011. The consultation closed on 25 November 2011.

   More information from the Scottish Government

   Guidance on the Equality Duty specific to Wales and Scotland is
   available from the Equality and Human Rights Commission.
