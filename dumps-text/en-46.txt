   Policy statements First published: 27/07/2022 Last updated: 27/07/2022

   We set out the final rules and guidance for a new Consumer Duty that
   will set higher and clearer standards of consumer protection across
   financial services and require firms to put their customers’ needs
   first. We also respond to feedback to CP21/36.

   [121]Read PS22/9 [PDF]

   [122]Read FG22/5 [PDF]

What we are changing 

   We are introducing rules comprising:
     * A new Consumer Principle that requires firms to act to deliver good
       outcomes for retail customers.
     * Cross-cutting rules providing greater clarity on our expectations
       under the new Principle and helping firms interpret the four
       outcomes (see below).
     * Rules relating to the four outcomes we want to see under the
       Consumer Duty. These represent key elements of the firm-consumer
       relationship which are instrumental in helping to drive good
       outcomes for customers.

   These outcomes relate to:
     * products and services
     * price and value
     * consumer understanding
     * consumer support

   Our rules require firms to consider the needs, characteristics and
   objectives of their customers – including those with characteristics of
   vulnerability – and how they behave, at every stage of the customer
   journey. As well as acting to deliver good customer outcomes, firms
   will need to understand and evidence whether those outcomes are being
   met.

Who this affects   

   This policy and guidance is likely to interest:   
     * regulated firms, including those in the e-money and payments sector

     * consumer organisations and individual consumers
     * industry groups/trade bodies
     * policy makers and regulatory bodies
     * industry experts and commentators
     * academics and think tanks

Next steps  

   The rules and guidance we are introducing come into force on a phased
   basis:
     * for new and existing products or services that are open to sale or
       renewal the rules come into force on 31 July 2023
     * for closed products or services, the rules come into force on 31
       July 2024

   During the implementation period, we'll be hosting a series of industry
   events to help firms prepare for the new rules coming into force. If
   you’d like to hear more about future Consumer Duty events and related
   communications, please [123]sign up for email updates.
