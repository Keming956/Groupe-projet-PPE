Active Duty Retirement

   Members who accumulate 20 or more years of active service are eligible
   for retirement. There are three non-disability retirement plans
   currently in effect for active duty retirees. These are Final Pay plan,
   High-36 Month Average plan, and Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986
   (more commonly referred to as REDUX) plan.

   The basic retirement formula is:

   Retired Pay Base X Multiplier %

Final Pay Plan

   The Final Pay plan uses the Final Pay method to determine the retired
   pay base. See the Retirement page.

   The Final Pay plan uses a multiplier % that is 2.5% times the years of
   creditable service. The years of creditable service for an active duty
   retirement calculation is the sum of years of active service (i.e.,
   active duty or full-time National Guard duty) and any additional years
   computed by adding all reserve points, if any (except those for active
   service)and dividing by 360.

High-36 Plan

   The High-36 retirement plan uses the High-36 method to determine the
   retired pay base. See the Retirement page.

   The High-36 retirement plan uses a multiplier % that is the same as the
   final pay plan.

REDUX Plan

   The REDUX retirement plan is an option available only to active duty
   members who entered service on or after August 1, 1986. It includes a
   $30,000 Career Status Bonus (CSB).

   The REDUX retirement plan uses the High-36 method to determine the
   retired pay base. See the Retirement page.

   The REDUX retirement plan uses a multiplier that is the same as for the
   High-36 retirement plan, except the multiplier is reduced by one
   percentage point for each year less than 30 the member has at
   retirement.

Years of Service

   The years of creditable service for computation of the retired pay
   percentage multiplier include all active duty and any credited reserve
   points divided by 360.
