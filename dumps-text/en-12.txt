Duty suspensions and autonomous tariff quotas

   Duty suspensions are designed to help UK and Crown Dependency
   (Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey) businesses remain competitive in
   the global marketplace. They do this by suspending import duties on
   certain goods, normally those used in domestic production.

   These suspensions do not apply to other duties that may be chargeable
   like VAT or trade remedies duty, such as anti-dumping duty.

   Duty suspensions allow unlimited quantities to be imported into the UK
   at a reduced tariff rate. Autonomous tariff quotas (ATQs) allow limited
   quantities to be imported at a reduced rate.

   Duty suspensions and ATQs are temporary and can be used by any UK
   business while in force. They are applied on a ‘Most Favoured Nation’
   (‘MFN’) basis. This means that goods subject to these suspensions or
   quotas can be imported into the UK from any country or territory at the
   specified reduced tariff rate.

   When more than one tariff concession applies, importers will wish to
   ensure that their goods are entered at the most advantageous rate.

   Read guidance on [57]declaring goods ‘not at risk’ of moving to the EU
   if you are importing goods subject to a duty suspension or an ATQ into
   Northern Ireland.

Current duty suspensions

   Find the current duty suspensions and quotas using the [58]Trade Tariff
   lookup tool.

   Duty suspensions for products which previously existed in the UK under
   the EU suspensions regime have been carried over into the UK’s
   independent regime. They have been retained, provided they came into
   force before, or as part of, the EU’s July 2020 update to ensure
   continuity for UK businesses.

   All current duty suspensions rolled over from the EU regime,
   including EU ATQs changed to duty suspensions, are extended until 31
   December 2028.

Apply for a new duty suspension

   The 2023 application window for new duty suspensions has now closed.
   The deadline for applications was 11:59pm on Sunday 6 August 2023. The
   government has received 245 applications.

   Between 20 September 2023 and 18 October 2023, the government ran a
   4-week objections window.

   The government has published a list of all products and HS commodity
   code classifications on which suspensions are being considered as a
   result of this year’s application process. The wider public were
   invited to submit any objections they had on the proposed suspensions.

   The objections window has now closed, but the list is still accessible
   below.
     * [59]Notice of UK duty suspensions: 2023 application window (ODS,
       28.0 KB)

   The list is not an indication of whether an application has been
   successful. The government expects to confirm the outcome of all
   applications in early 2024.

   The government is currently considering objections that have been
   received as part of an assessment process. Whilst individual objections
   will not be publicly disclosed, the government may reach out to
   applicants if any further clarification of, or information related to,
   their application is required.

   An objection to an application does not automatically lead to a
   rejection of that application. All objections are being considered
   alongside all other information, where the government is taking into
   account the core criteria and any other relevant considerations.

   The criteria and examples of the wider considerations the government
   will consider when assessing applications are set out below.

   Continue to monitor this page for updates or [60]subscribe to get
   emails alerts for this page.

How we will assess applications in 2023

   Applications submitted as part of this process need to meet both of the
   following criteria:
     * the product you are seeking a suspension on should not be not
       traded between persons who are related parties (defined in
       [61]Regulation 8(4) of the Customs Tariff (Suspension of Import
       Duty Rates) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020) in circumstances which
       would not enable other United Kingdom businesses to benefit from
       the suspension
     * the same product (falling under the same commodity code) or similar
       products, should not be produced in the UK or Crown Dependencies,
       not produced in sufficient quantities, or production should be
       temporarily insufficient. (Products other than raw products are
       taken to be produced in the UK or a Crown Dependency if they are
       partly or wholly manufactured in the UK or a Crown Dependency.
       Simple assembly operations, repacking products, or preparing
       products for shipment or transportation would not normally be
       considered production processes)

   We strongly recommend you ensure your application meets these criteria.
   If these criteria are not met, your application may not be considered.

   Tariff suspensions are designed to help UK and Crown Dependency
   businesses remain competitive in the global marketplace. They do this
   by suspending, either in whole or in part, UK Global Tariff import
   duties on certain goods, normally those used as inputs into domestic
   production processes.

   When assessing applications, the government will also take into account
   relevant considerations. These may include:
     * international arrangements to which the UK is a party (for example
       free trade agreements)
     * factors such as:
          + the interests of consumers in the United Kingdom
          + the interests of producers in the United Kingdom of the goods
            concerned
          + the desirability of maintaining and promoting the external
            trade of the United Kingdom
          + the desirability of maintaining and promoting productivity in
            the United Kingdom
          + the extent to which the goods concerned are subject to
            competition
     * how other government policies may be affected by the proposed duty
       suspension (such as trade remedies)
     * any circumvention risks due to tariff reclassification

Outcome of the 2021 duty suspension window

   The government invited applications for duty suspensions between 1 June
   and 31 July 2021. As a result, over 100 measures were implemented on 1
   January 2023.

       application window (ODT, 55.1 KB)

Coronavirus (COVID-19) critical products

   The UK government implemented tariff suspensions on a number of medical
   items critical in the response to COVID-19 on 1 January 2021. The
   government has extended the suspension of import duties for the
   majority of these products until 31 December 2023. Three suspensions
   were expired for goods where there have been no imports under the
   suspensions (5603 91 10, 2905 44 11 00 and 2905 44 99 00). This was
   based on HMRC raw customs data for the period January 2021 to August
   2022.

   In an effort to provide continuity for businesses and ease pressures on
   the NHS, these suspensions are now extended until 31 December 2028.

Sunflower-seed oil

   The UK government will implement a tariff suspension on sunflower-seed
   oil on 1 January 2023 in response to supply chain disruption. This
   measure will take effect until 31 December 2024.

Current ATQs

   The UK currently has 6 existing ATQs:
     * 5 ATQs for fish products
     * 1 ATQ for raw cane sugar

   Read more detail on these products:
     * [64]List of autonomous tariff quotas (ODT, 29.6 KB)

ATQs for fish products

   4 ATQs  for fish products will continue at current volume levels until
   31 December 2024. These will be reviewed ahead of that date.

   ATQ order number 05.2794 is set at 6,500 tonnes for 2023.

ATQ for raw cane sugar

   The UK implemented an ATQ on raw cane sugar on 1 January 2021 following
   its departure from the EU. Following a subsequent review of all UK ATQs
   in 2021, we maintained the volume level of this ATQ at 260,000 tonnes.

   In the context of recent domestic supply challenges and significant
   increases in sugar prices, we reached out to a range of stakeholders in
   Autumn 2023 and welcomed information from any interested stakeholders
   via contact details provided on gov.uk. We wanted to understand any
   issues in the UK sugar market and to consider potential mitigations
   that the Government could take in 2023.

   We received eight responses in total, providing information from a
   range of stakeholders who we know have an interest in this area,
   including representatives from the industry and from those representing
   consumer and retail interests.

   Whilst the responses received reflected the different interests of
   stakeholders, there were some common themes. These are summarised
   below:
     * The relatively poor UK and European sugar beet harvests in 2022 led
       to increased imports of raw cane sugar in 2023.  Currently, the
       harvest outlook for the 2023 to 2024 season is more positive.
     * World sugar prices are high which is pushing up prices in the UK
       and the EU. The relatively smaller 2022 harvest in the UK and the
       EU, which has resulted in higher-than-normal imports to meet
       demand, has caused the European price to rise even above the world
       price level. Some stakeholders also noted the impact of tariff
       policy on prices.

   Overall, there were varying views on the proposed Government options
   for action in this area in 2023. There was no consensus on the
   preferred approach. Some stakeholders were in favour of providing
   greater access for tariff-free sources of sugar, and some were in
   favour of an uplift to the ATQ. Some were in favour of both. Others
   were opposed to any change and cited concerns about the impact on
   domestic production, other producers (for example, in developing
   countries) or standards. There was also no consensus on the impact any
   such change would have on consumer prices.

   In coming to a decision, the Government took into account the
   stakeholder views received as part of this process. We also drew on our
   internal analysis including consideration of a range of factors,
   including potential impacts on consumers, producers and the UK’s wider
   strategic trade objectives.

   On the basis of these considerations, the Government has decided to
   maintain the current sugar ATQ for 2023 at the existing level of
   260,000 tonnes for the remainder of 2023.
