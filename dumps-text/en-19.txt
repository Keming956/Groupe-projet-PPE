Tax when you buy shares

    4. [42]Special share arrangements

Overview

   When you buy shares, you usually pay a tax or duty of 0.5% on the
   transaction.

   If you buy:
     * shares [43]electronically, you’ll pay Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT)
     * shares [44]using a stock transfer form, you’ll pay Stamp Duty if
       the transaction is over £1,000

   You’ll have to pay tax at 1.5% if you transfer shares into some
   [45]‘depositary receipt schemes’ or ‘clearance services’.

   You pay tax on the price you pay for the shares, even if their actual
   market value is much higher.

Transactions you pay tax on

   You pay tax when you buy:
     * existing shares in a company incorporated in the UK
     * an option to buy shares
     * an interest in shares, for example an interest in the money from
       selling them
     * shares in a foreign company that has a share register in the UK
     * rights arising from shares, for example rights you have when new
       shares are issued

When you do not pay tax

   You do not have to pay tax if you:
     * are given shares for nothing
     * subscribe to a new issue of shares in a company
     * buy shares in an ‘open ended investment company’ (OEIC) from the
       fund manager
     * buy units in a unit trust from the fund manager

   You do not normally have to pay Stamp Duty or SDRT if you buy foreign
   shares outside the UK. But you may have to pay [46]other taxes.

When you sell the shares

   You may need to pay [47]Capital Gains Tax when you sell your shares.

Help and advice

   [48]Contact Stamp Duty share enquiries for general information about
   Stamp Duty on shares.

   [49]Contact Stamp Duty Reserve Tax enquiries if you have questions
   about Stamp Duty on electronic paperless share transactions.

   You can also [50]get professional help (for example, from a tax
   adviser) with your tax.
