Trade Tariff: look up commodity codes, duty and VAT rates

   Use this service to find a commodity code for goods you’re importing to
   or exporting from the UK.

   You can also use the service to:
     * check if there’s duty or VAT to pay
     * find out about suspensions or reductions

   You’ll need a commodity code when you fill in a customs declaration
   form, so you pay the correct amount of tax and duties.

   Start now

Before you start

   To find a commodity code for your goods, you’ll need details of the
   product you’re importing or exporting. This could include:
     * the type of product
     * what the product is used for
     * the materials used to make it
     * how it’s produced
     * the way it’s packaged

Help with finding the right commodity code

   If you’re not sure how to classify your goods, you can:
     * check the guidance on hard to classify goods
     * use the A to Z of classified goods to find commodity codes for
       common products
