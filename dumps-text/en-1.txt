Participation of young people in education, employment or training

This page provides information on the law surrounding the participation of
young people (16-18 years old) in education, employment or training. This
includes the various options available to young people to ensure
participation and the duties of the Local Authority to encourage
participation.

     The law now requires all young people in England to continue in
     education or training until at least their 18th birthday.

Is education compulsory after the age of 16?

   Under previous legislation it was compulsory for young people to remain
   in education until the age of 16. However, as a result of legislation
   introduced in September 2013, the law now requires that young people
   continue in education, employment or training until the age of 18.

   Statutory guidance published by the Department of Education which
   explains the legal position can be accessed [361]here.


Why has the participation age been raised?

   This change was introduced to improve the career and life prospects for
   young people.

   There are various advantages to remaining in education or training for
   longer:
     * Young people can develop a greater range of skills
     * The likelihood of unemployment is significantly reduced
     * An increase in earning potential
     * Offers the opportunity for young people who are disengaged with
       mainstream education to develop new skills in an alternative
       setting.

What are the options available for young people?

     * Option one is to study full-time at school, college or with a
       training provider. The definition of full-time participation is at
       least 540 hours a year; this is around 18 hours per week.
     * Option two is full-time employment or volunteering (full-time is
       counted as more than 20 hours a week) combined with part-time study
       or training. To count as full-time work, the job must be for 8 or
       more weeks consecutively and for 20 or more hours per week.
       Part-time education or training alongside full-time work must be at
       least 280 hours per year.
     * Option three is to enrol in an apprenticeship, traineeship or
       supported internship.

   ([362]Section 2 Education and Skills Act 2008)

What are the duties of the Local Authority?

   The Local Authority has broad duties to encourage, enable and assist
   young people, between the ages of 16-18, to participate in education,
   employment or training.

   The legislative framework:

   [363]Sch 2, Para 4 Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act
   2009 – ‘’A Local Education Authority may secure the provision for their
   area of full-time education suitable to the requirements of persons
   over compulsory school age who have not attained the age of 19.’’

   [364]Section 10 Education and Skills Act 2008 – ‘’A Local Education
   Authority in England must ensure that its functions are (so far as they
   are capable of being so exercised) exercised so as to promote the
   effective participation in education or training of persons belonging
   to its area.’’

   [365]Section 12 Education and Skills Act 2008 – ‘’A Local Education
   Authority in England must make arrangements to enable it to establish
   (so far as it is possible to do so) the identities of persons belonging
   to its area who are not participating (in education or training.)’’
   Strategic leadership should be provided up until the time that there
   was a meeting due to take place which and therefore there are many
   strategic support organisations which govern this particular

In so far as meeting these duties, Local Authorities are expected to:

     * Provide strategic leadership in their communities to ensure that
       there is a network of support available which encourages, enables
       and assists the participation of young people in education,
       training and employment. This includes liaising with local partners
       such as employers, Jobcentre Plus, community sector organisations
       and youth offending teams.
     * Local Authorities must collect information about young people in
       their area who are not participating and to target their resources
       on those who require them most.
     * Local Authorities are expected to liase with education providers to
       identify children under the age of 16 years old who are at risk of
       not participating post-16 and for intensive support to be provided
       to remedy the situation. This is particularly important in relation
       to children with SEND who are significantly less likely to
       participate post-16 in comparison to their peers without SEND.
     * Every young person who reaches the age of 16 or 17 years old in any
       given academic year is entitled to an offer of a suitable place, by
       the end of September, to continue in education or training the
       following year. However, there is not the same duties on the Local
       Authority to offer the young person a place to continue their
       education or training; the duty is on the young person to apply to
       relevant education or training providers in order to obtain a
       place.

What are the duties of education providers?

   [366]The Education and Skills Act 2008 placed two Raising Participation
   Age related duties on education providers with regard to 16 and 17 year
   olds:
     * [367]Section 11 places a duty on education providers to promote
       good attendance to enable young people to meet their duty to
       participate.
     * [368]Section 13 places a duty on education providers to inform
       their local authority when a young person is no longer
       participating, for example, if they have dropped out.

   [369]Under Section 29  Education Act 2011, schools are under a duty to
   secure independent careers guidance for pupils in Years 8-13 on the
   full range of education and training options, including
   apprenticeships. Schools are expected to work in partnership with local
   employers and other education and training providers to ensure that
   young people have a wide range of options available to them.

Enforcement

   The legal requirement to participate is on the young person, not the
   parent/carer. Enforcement does not form part of the current law and
   therefore young people will not receive a sanction for
   non-participation. This could change in the future as this position is
   regularly reviewed.
