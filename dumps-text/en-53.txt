Overview

   The temporary increase to the nil rate band for Stamp Duty Land Tax
   (SDLT), which is the rate before you start paying SDLT on residential
   property has been extended.

   Rather than ending on 31 March 2021, the temporary nil rate band of
   £500,000 will be in place until 30 June 2021. Then from 1 July 2021 to
   30 September 2021 the nil rate band will be £250,000. The nil rate band
   will return to the standard amount of £125,000 on 1 October 2021.

   The rate of SDLT which applies to your purchase depends on the date
   that you [45]complete your property purchase and not the date that you
   exchanged contracts.

Residential Rates on purchases from 8 July 2020 to 30 June 2021

   If you purchase a residential property between 8 July 2020 to 30 June
   2021, you only start to pay SDLT on the amount that you pay for the
   property above £500,000. These rates apply whether you are buying your
   first home or have owned property before.

   You can use the table to work out the SDLT due:
            Property or lease premium or transfer value          SDLT rate
   Up to £500,000                                                Zero
   The next £425,000 (the portion from £500,001 to £925,000)     5%
   The next £575,000 (the portion from £925,001 to £1.5 million) 10%
   The remaining amount (the portion above £1.5 million)         12%

   From 8 July 2020 to 30 June 2021 the special rules for first time
   buyers are replaced by the reduced rates set out above.

   Use the [46]SDLT calculator to work out how much tax you’ll pay.

Residential Rates on purchases from 1 July 2021 to 30 September 2021

   If you purchase a residential property between 1 July 2021 to 30
   September 2021, you only start to pay SDLT on the amount that you pay
   for the property above £250,000.

   You can use the table to work out the SDLT due.
            Property or lease premium or transfer value          SDLT rate
   Up to £250,000                                                zero
   The next £675,000 (the portion from £250,001 to £925,000)     5%
   The next £575,000 (the portion from £925,001 to £1.5 million) 10%
   The remaining amount (the portion above £1.5 million)         12%

   From 1 July 2021 the special rules and rates for first time buyers
   apply, including first time buyers purchasing property through a shared
   ownership scheme.

   Use the [47]SDLT calculator to work out how much tax you’ll pay.

Higher rates for additional properties

   The 3% higher rate for purchases of additional dwellings applies on top
   of temporary reduced rates above for the period 8 July 2020 to 30 June
   2021 and also for the period 1 July 2021 to 30 September.

   The following rates apply:

Higher Rates from 8 July 2020 to 30 June 2021

            Property or lease premium or transfer value          SDLT rate
   Up to £500,000                                                3%
   The next £425,000 (the portion from £500,001 to £925,000)     8%
   The next £575,000 (the portion from £925,001 to £1.5 million) 13%
   The remaining amount (the portion above £1.5 million)         15%

Higher Rates from 1 July 2021 to 30 September 2021

            Property or lease premium or transfer value          SDLT rate
   Up to £250,000                                                3%
   The next £675,000 (the portion from £250,001 to £925,000)     8%
   The next £575,000 (the portion from £925,001 to £1.5 million) 13%
   The remaining amount (the portion above £1.5 million)         15%

   From 1 October 2021 the higher rates will then apply on top of the
   standard rates of SDLT.

   Use the SDLT [48]calculator to work out how much tax you’ll pay.

New leasehold sales and transfers

   The nil rate band which applies to the ‘net present value’ of any rents
   payable for residential property is also increased to £500,000 from 8
   July 2020 until 30 June 2021. From 1 July 2021 to 30 September 2021 the
   nil rate band will then be decreased to £250,000.

   The following rates will apply:

From 8 July 2020 to 30 June 2021

   Net Present Value of any Rent SDLT rate
   Up to £500,000                Zero
   Over £500,000                 1%

From 1 July 2021 to 30 September 2021

   Net Present Value of any Rent SDLT rate
   Up to £250,000                Zero
   Over £250,000                 1%

   Companies as well as individuals buying residential property below the
   nil rate band thresholds shown in the above tables will also benefit
   from these changes, as will companies that buy residential property of
   any value where they meet the relief conditions from the corporate 15%
   SDLT charge.

   On the 1 October 2021 the temporary rates of SDLT will revert back to
   the standard rates that were in place prior to 8 July 2020.
