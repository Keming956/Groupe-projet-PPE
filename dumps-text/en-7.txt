Disabled people must work from home to do ‘their duty’, says UK minister

   People with mobility and mental health problems should work from home
   or lose benefits under new policy
     * [109]UK politics live – latest updates

   People with mobility and mental health problems will be asked to work
   from home or lose benefits as part of what a UK government minister
   described today as doing “their duty”.

   The policy will be set out on Wednesday as part of the autumn statement
   amid a drive by [112]Rishi Sunak to make changes to the welfare system,
   which he described on Monday as “unsustainable”.

   Hundreds of thousands of people will be told to look for work that they
   can do from home or face having their benefits cut by £4,680 a year,
   under plans that were first reported by the Times.

   Laura Trott, chief secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: “Of course
   there should be support for people to help them into work but
   ultimately there is a duty on citizens if they are able to go out to
   work they should. Those who can work and contribute should contribute.”

   Earlier, she told Times Radio the government’s plans were “not just
   about forcing people out”. She added: “It’s saying we’re going to put
   the right mechanisms around you to help you with that. But ultimately,
   you have to engage with that, and that is an obligation on you as a
   citizen to do this. And if you don’t do this, we will look at
   sanctions.”

   There was strong criticism from charities. Ayla Ozmen, the director of
   policy and campaigns at the anti-poverty charity Z2K, described the
   plans as “rushed and ill-thought-out”.

   “There is no evidence to support the idea that there are fully remote
   jobs available that are suitable for these groups,” she said.

   “This is simply a cut for those of us who become seriously ill or
   disabled in the future and need the support of social security, and
   risks worsening people’s health and pushing them further from work.”

   Sarah White, the head of policy at the national disability charity
   Sense, said: “Everyone should be able to work if they want to and can,
   but this latest government move looks sets to punish disabled people,
   adding more anxiety on to disabled households that are already
   struggling.”

   Details of the policy will be set out by the Department for Work and
   Pensions (DWP) after consultations by the government some months ago
   about work capability assessment (WCA).

   Trott also went further than Sunak or [119]Jeremy Hunt when asked if
   the autumn statement would go beyond business tax cuts. Asked if the
   chancellor would be cutting taxes for individuals, she told the BBC’s
   Today programme: “That is where the focus is.”

   “In broad narrative terms this is a big moment for us, for people at
   home, because inflation has halved. We know how difficult it has been
   and it will mean important things for the household budget.”

   [124]The UK government is about to make some disabled benefits
   claimants even poorer | Lucy Webster
   Read more

   Charities have already warned that DWP plans to tighten health-related
   benefits – which are provided to more than 3 million working-age adults
   in the UK – could cause “huge anxiety” and mean “sanctions” for
   disabled people.

   Campaigners have also said that welfare changes could lead to many
   losing out on almost £400 a month in support. Tony Wilson, the director
   of the Institute for Employment Studies, told the Guardian in September
   that extra support to help disabled people into work should not come
   with such stringent conditions.

   Speaking on Monday in London about the plans to make changes to
   benefits, the prime minister said : “We believe in the inherent dignity
   of a good job. And we believe that work, not welfare, is the best route
   out of poverty.”

   “Yet right now, around 2 million people of working age are not working
   at all. That is a national scandal and an enormous waste of human
   potential. So, we must do more to support those who can work to do so.

   The number of people on health-related benefits has risen by a quarter
   since the eve of the Covid pandemic. Most of these are in the limited
   capability for work-related activity (LCWRA) group, who receive the
   additional £390.06 a month.
