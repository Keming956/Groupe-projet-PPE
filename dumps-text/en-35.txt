Guidance on the professional duty of candour

   Joint guidance with the General Medical Council on the duty of candour

Contents

     * Overview
     * [84]Read the professional duty of candour

   All healthcare professionals have a duty of candour – this is a
   professional responsibility to be honest when things go wrong.

   This [85]guidance on the professional duty of candour ([86]Cymraeg) was
   produced in collaboration with the General Medical Council and has been
   refreshed in March 2022.

   This guidance complements the joint statement on the professional duty
   of candour by professional healthcare regulators (October 2014) and
   section 14 of [87]the Code.

   It focuses not only on the duty to be open and honest with patients but
   also on the need to be open and honest within organisations in
   reporting adverse incidents or near misses that may have led to harm.

   Professionals, students and employers can find out more about the
   professional duty of candour and how to apply it in practice by
   watching our webinar which took place 25 April.
