1. Introduction

   This part concentrates on goods liable to excise duty. It lists the
   rates of excise duty chargeable for the following:
     * wine and made-wine
     * beer
     * cider and perry
     * spirits
     * low alcohol beverages
     * imported composite goods containing alcohol
     * tobacco products
     * hydrocarbon oil — this section includes details about rebates for
       such products
     * Climate Change Levy
     * biofuels

   Use this guide with the [56]Trade Tariff: look up commodity codes, duty
   and VAT rates to help with commodity code numbers (for example, 2204 10
   11 for certain wines).

   This part also contains some information and reference about excise
   drawback and excise duty reliefs.

1.1 Important note on definitions

   The definitions used in this part are those prescribed for excise duty
   purposes only.

1.2 Background

   Excise duty is chargeable, in addition to any customs duty which may be
   due, on the goods described in this part. These goods may be either of
   UK origin, received in the UK following an intra EU movement or
   imported from outside the UK or EU.

   The duty falls due at the time when the goods leave any duty suspension
   arrangements, that is when:
     * they are released for consumption or otherwise made available for
       consumption (generally through the warehouse system) registered
       trader (REDS) or occasional importer receives them in the UK
     * a vendor makes a delivery under distance selling arrangements
     * missing consignments and other dutiable shortages are discovered
     * goods imported for personal use are then sold or put to commercial
       use

1.3 Tax type code

   Different rates can apply to different sub categories of goods. In
   addition to the commodity description and code number each excisable
   item has allocated a tax type code number (for example, 451 for
   spirits). These identify the type and rate of excise duty payable. They
   are included in the tables listed in section [57]Wine and made-wine.
   [58]UK Trade Tariff: Box 47(a) tax type codes also lists tax codes
   which are declared on the Single Administrative Document (SAD) import
   document.

   Reduced rates of duty were introduced from 1 June 2002 for beer
   produced by independent breweries producing no more than 30,000
   hectolitres. For breweries producing between 5,000 and 30,000
   hectolitres, the following arithmetical formula is used to calculate
   the rate of duty.

   (Annual production — 2,500) ÷ annual production × standard rate of duty
   at the time concerned. This must be rounded up to the nearest penny.

   Reduced rates of duty were also introduced from 1 June 2004 for beer
   produced by independent breweries producing between 30,000 and 60,000
   hectolitres.

   The following arithmetical formula is used to calculate the rate of
   duty for these breweries.

   (Annual production — (2,500 — 8.3% ABV of annual production in excess
   of 30,000 hectolitres)) × standard rate of duty at the time concerned ÷
   annual production.

   This must be rounded up to the nearest penny.

3.1 Definitions and notes

   ‘Beer’ includes ale, porter, stout and any other description of beer
   and any liquor which is sold as beer or as a substitute for beer and on
   analysis a sample is found to be of an alcoholic strength exceeding
   0.5%. ABV is the proportion of alcohol as a percentage of the fermented
   beer.

   The duty is charged on alcoholic strength to one decimal place, for
   example 4.19% ABV becomes 4.1% ABV (ignore figures after the first
   decimal place).

   Low alcohol beverages made from malt exceeding 0.5% ABV but not
   exceeding 1.2% ABV are not liable to excise duty.

   Examples of beer-based beverages are set out in the section on [61]Low
   alcohol beverages which also shows the rate of excise duty for these
   products up to 5.5% ABV. Beer and spirits mixtures exceeding 1.2% ABV
   are liable to duty at the spirits rate. Beer mixtures containing
   dutiable liquors other than spirits and exceeding 5.5% ABV are liable
   at the appropriate made-wine rate.

   Small brewery beer relief will still be available on the general Beer
   Duty element of beer above 7.5% ABV. However, it will not apply to high
   strength Beer Duty and no further relief will be applied to the reduced
   rate of general Beer Duty for lower strength beers.

4. Cider and perry

   Cider (or perry) — manufactured in the UK by a registered maker of
   cider or perry or imported.
   Class or description Tax type code Rate of excise duty
   Sparkling made in the UK or imported exceeding 5.5% ABV but less than
   8.5% ABV 485 £288.10 per hectolitre
   Sparkling made in the UK or imported exceeding 1.2% ABV but not
   exceeding 5.5% ABV 481 £40.38 per hectolitre
   Still made in the UK or imported exceeding 1.2% ABV but less than 6.9%
   ABV 481 £40.38 per hectolitre
   Still made in the UK or imported at least 6.9% ABV but not exceeding
   7.5% ABV 487 £50.71 per hectolitre
   Still made in the UK or imported exceeding 7.5% ABV but less than 8.5%
   ABV 483 £61.04 per hectolitre
   If total abv does not exceed 1.2% ABV 431 Nil

4.1 Definitions and notes

   ‘Cider’ means cider (or perry) of a strength of less than 8.5% of ABV
   (at 20°C) obtained from the fermentation of apple or pear juice without
   the addition at any time of any alcoholic liquor or of any liquor or
   substance which communicates colour or flavour other than such as the
   Commissioners may allow as appearing to them to be necessary to produce
   cider (or perry).

   Cider or perry is chargeable at the sparkling rate (a) if the container
   has an excess pressure due to carbon dioxide in solution of 3 bar or
   more, or (b) if the container has a mushroom stopper held in place by a
   tie or fastening — regardless of the pressure.

   See section on [62]Wine and made-wine for definition of ‘mushroom
   stopper.’

5. Spirits

   Class or description — UK-produced whisky Tax type code Rate of excise
   duty
   Wholly malt 461 £28.74 per litre of alcohol in the spirits at a

   temperature of 20°C

5.1 Notes

   If spirits are imported in bottles which the importer does not wish to
   be opened for test, HMRC will normally be prepared to accept excise
   duty on the basis of a declared strength of 77% ABV volume for
   drinkable spirits. HMRC reserves the right to test any consignment.

6. Low alcohol beverages

   Wine where the alcohol strength does not exceed 5.5% ABV.

   Made-wine where the alcohol strength does not exceed 5.5% ABV.

   Mixed drinks made from cider or perry base where the alcohol strength
   does not exceed 5.5% ABV.

   Beer-based beverage duty only applies to beverages of an alcoholic
   strength exceeding 1.2% ABV but not exceeding 5.5% ABV.

   There are 2 different rates of duty for a beer-based beverage:
     * one where the alcohol by volume content exceeds 1.2% ABV but does
       not exceed 2.8% ABV
     * the other where the alcohol by volume content exceeds 2.8% ABV but
       does not exceed 5.5% ABV

   Class or description Tax type code Rate of excise duty

   Beer-based beverage exceeding 2.8% volume but not exceeding 5.5% 473
   £19.08 per hectolitre for every 1% ABV to the nearest 0.1%

6.1 Definitions and notes

   Beer-based beverage duty only applies to beverages of an alcoholic
   strength exceeding 1.2% ABV but not exceeding 5.5% ABV and cannot be
   dutiable as a ‘made-wine’.

   This does not include cider, perry and beer as defined in sections for
   [63]cider and perry and [64]beer. The following are classified as
   beer-based beverages:
     * shandy made with lemonade, or a mixture of beer and lemonade, lemon
       cordial, lemon flavouring, lemon juice, or lemon squash
     * lager-and-lime, or a mixture of beer and lime cordial, lime
       flavouring, lime juice, lime squash, or limeade
     * ginger beer shandy, shandygaff, or a mixture of beer and ginger,
       ginger cordial, ginger flavouring, ginger squash, or unfermented
       ginger beer
     * a mixture of beer and:
          + fruit cordial, fruit flavourings, fruit flavoured carbonated
            water, fruit juice or fruit squash
          + any alcoholic liquor or other alcoholic substance

   A reduced rate of general Beer Duty should be applied to beer-based
   beverages of an alcoholic strength exceeding 1.2% ABV but not exceeding
   2.8% ABV. The tax type codes 444 or 446 should be used based on the
   origin of the product. Note these are identical to the tax type codes
   for low alcohol beer found in chapter 3. Where the beer-based beverage
   is of an alcoholic strength exceeding 2.8% ABV but not exceeding 5.5%
   ABV then the tax type code 473 should be used regardless of origin.

7. Imported composite goods containing alcohol

   Goods containing ingredients liable to excise duty are chargeable with:
     * Customs Duty where appropriate on the goods as a whole
     * excise duty on the ingredient

   The tax type codes and excise duty rates are the same as for the type
   of alcohol used as the ingredient, for example, spirits (451) £28.74
   per litre of alcohol.

7.1 Exceptions

   Class or description Excise duty

8.1 Definitions and notes

   For the purposes of Tobacco Products Duty, tobacco products are defined
   in the Tobacco Products (Descriptions of Products) Order 2003 SI
   2003/1471. The following is a summary of those definitions.

   ‘Tobacco products’ means any of the [67]products listed which are
   manufactured wholly or partly from tobacco or any substance used as a
   substitute for tobacco but does not include herbal smoking products.

   ‘Cigarettes’ means any roll of tobacco capable of being smoked as they
   are and not falling within any of the descriptions of a cigar, or rolls
   of tobacco that, by simple non-industrial handling, are:
     * inserted into cigarette-paper tubes
     * wrapped in cigarette paper

   Any cigarette more than 9 centimetres (cm) long (excluding any filter
   or mouthpiece) will be treated as if each 9cm or part thereof were a
   separate cigarette.

   ‘Cigars’ include products of the following descriptions.

   (1) rolls of tobacco made entirely of natural tobacco.

   (2) rolls of tobacco, even if mixed with substances other than tobacco,
   with an outer wrapper of natural tobacco.

   (3) rolls of tobacco with a threshed blend filler of tobacco or tobacco
   mixed with substances other than tobacco, with a binder and outer
   wrapper of reconstituted tobacco.

   The outer wrapper must have the normal colour of a cigar and be fitted
   in spiral form with an acute angle of at least 30 degrees to the
   longitudinal axis of the cigar. The outer wrapper must cover the cigar
   in full including any filter but not (in the case of cigars with a
   mouthpiece) the mouthpiece.

   Cigars falling within this description must have a unit weight
   (excluding filter or mouthpiece) of not less than 1.2 grams (gm).

   (4) rolls of tobacco with a threshed blend filler of tobacco or tobacco
   mixed with substances other than tobacco and with an outer wrapper of
   reconstituted tobacco that has the normal colour of a cigar.

   The outer wrapper must cover the cigar in full including any filter but
   not (in the case of cigars with a mouthpiece) the mouthpiece.

   Any binder may be made of a material other than tobacco or
   reconstituted tobacco.

   Cigars falling within this definition must have a unit weight
   (excluding any filter or mouthpiece) of not less than 2.3gm and a
   circumference over at least one third of its length of at least 34
   millimetres (mm).

   A cigarillo that falls within one of these descriptions is a cigar.

   ‘Hand-rolling tobacco’ means tobacco:
     * of which more than 25% by weight of the tobacco particles have a
       width of less than 1mm
     * which is sold or intended to be sold for making into cigarettes by
       hand
     * which is of a kind used for making into cigarettes by hand

   ‘Chewing tobacco’ includes any product prepared for chewing that
   consists in whole or in part of tobacco, or substitute for tobacco, and
   does not fall within the definition of one of the other tobacco
   products. It does not include products that are intended solely as an
   aid for persons to give up smoking.

   ‘Tobacco for heating’ means:
     * tobacco capable of being heated, without combustion, in order to
       produce or flavour vapour
     * not cigarettes, cigars, hand-rolling tobacco, other smoking
       tobacco, or chewing tobacco

   ‘Other smoking tobacco’ means tobacco that has been cut, split, twisted
   or pressed into blocks, and is capable of being smoked without further
   industrial processing, or tobacco refuse put up for retail sale that
   can be smoked, and which does not fall within the definition of one of
   the other tobacco products.

   ‘Herbal smoking products’ means products commonly known as herbal
   cigarettes or herbal smoking mixtures. They do not include plant
   material which is specially grown or processed for use as a tobacco
   substitute

   Herbal material is usually readily identifiable as such by its texture
   and aromatic and pungent odour.

9. Hydrocarbon oil

   The Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979 (HODA) specifies full rates of
   excise duty on mineral oils and rebates of duty. The effect of applying
   a rebate of duty to a full rate is to create a lower rate of duty.
   These lower rates are known as rebated rates. This mechanism increases
   the number of effective rates of mineral oils excise duty.

9.1 Light oil

   Description of goods Full or unrebated rate of excise duty — £ per
   litre Rebate — £ per litre Type of tax code Effective rate of excise
   Unrebated (unmarked) — aviation gasoline (including light oil aviation
   turbine fuel) 0.3629 Nil 511 0.3629
   Unrebated (unmarked) — other unrebated light oil 0.6267 Nil 520 0.6267
   Rebated — furnace fuel (marked or unmarked) 0.6267 0.5289 521 0.0978

   Eligibility for rebate, as set out, is restricted as follows.

   Light oil furnace fuel — must be delivered marked and dyed ([71]Excise
   Notice 179, paragraph 8.4), or unmarked under individual ‘supplier’ or
   ‘user’ marking waiver.

   Unleaded petrol — qualifies for rebate without marking or other
   restriction provided it [72]meets the definition.

   Aviation turbine kerosene — may be delivered unmarked, for example, as
   aircraft fuel under marking waiver ([73]Excise Notice 179).

   Other kerosene — must be marked ([74]Excise Notice 179, paragraph 8.4)
   unless delivered under an individual ‘user or dealer’ marking waiver
   (Excise Notice 179), or imported in containers not exceeding 2.5 litres
   capacity and not for use as road fuel.

   Gas oil — must be marked ([75]Excise Notice 179, paragraph 8.4), unless

   Fuel oil or other heavy oil — qualifies for rebate without marking or
   other restriction, provided it is not intended for use as road fuel or
   road fuel extender.

   Markers must not be present in any oil (whether light or heavy)
   imported for delivery as road fuel or road fuel extender. The
   prohibitions relating to markers and obscuration of markers which must
   be observed are set out in [76]Excise Notice 179.

   The excise duty on hydrocarbon oil removed to a refinery, instead of
   being charged at the time of importation, is charged on the delivery of
   any goods from the refinery for home use, and is the same as that which
   would be payable on the importation of like goods. It is therefore
   allowed the same rebate as would be allowed on importation. Any customs
   duty chargeable is payable when the oil is taken into use at the
   refinery, whether as feedstock or otherwise.

   From 15 October 1993 the unit for calculation of duty on hydrocarbon
   oils is the standard litre, that is, litres at 15°C. If not already
   expressed in those terms quantities will need to be converted. Further
   information can be found in [77]Excise Notice 179 Appendix l.’

   It’s illegal for any person to mix any oil on which no rebate of excise
   duty has been allowed with:
     * fuel oil, gas oil, kerosene or light oil (including unleaded
       petrol) on which rebate of excise duty has been allowed
     * oil delivered without payment of excise duty

   except under and in accordance with either an approval granted by the
   Commissioners under the Mixing Regulations or a licence granted by the
   Commissioners.

   For excisedDuty purposes the methods of test whether any material is
   solid or semi-solid at a temperature of 15°C, and for the distillation
   characteristics of oil, are those laid down by the Institute of
   Petroleum and the Standardisation of Tar Products Test Committee.
   Further information can be found in [78]Notice 179, Appendix C.

10. Imported composite goods containing mineral oils

   Goods containing mineral oils as a part or ingredient of them are not
   liable to excise duty unless they are intended for use as substitutes
   for road fuels or as additives to road fuels or road fuel substitutes.
   Any articles imported for these purposes are chargeable with UK excise
   duty on 100% of their volume (not only on the percentage of mineral
   oil, if any, contained within them). The tax type codes and excise duty
   rates to be applied are the same as for the type of mineral oil which
   the product is intended to substitute for or is to be added to.

   Lubricating oils will not be charged with UK excise duty unless they
   are to be added to an additives package, in which case excise duty will
   be charged on the whole package.

       compressed natural gas (CNG) used as fuel in road vehicles are not
       liable to the levy
     * LPG when used for heating purposes is not subject to mineral oils

   for under the tax codes of biodiesel and heavy oil depending on the
   ratios of each.

   For the purpose of these duties:

   ‘Biodiesel’ is a diesel quality liquid fuel produced from biomass or
   waste cooking oil:
     * the total ester content of which is not less than 96.5% by weight
     * the sulphur content of which does not exceed 0.005% by weight

   ‘Bioblend’ is a fuel which is a mix of heavy oil and biodiesel in
   varying ratios.

   ‘Bioethanol’ is a liquid fuel consisting of ethanol produced from
   biomass and is capable of being used for the same purpose as light oil.
