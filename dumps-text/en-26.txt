Duty of Care by definition

   First referenced in the landmark case of Donoghue v Stevenson in 1932,
   Duty of Care has historically been connected to legal negligence. Over
   the past century however, the context of the term has drastically
   broadened, impacting organisations of all sizes.

   By definition, Duty of Care is a legal obligation imposed on an
   organisation, requiring adherence to a standard of reasonable care
   while preventing any acts that could foreseeably harm others.

   Much more than providing necessary employee benefits and insurance,
   Duty of Care in the context of the modern workplace encompasses the
   protection of an employee’s health, safety, security and wellbeing.
   Whether on a remote site, at the office, on business travel, on an
   international assignment or working from home, the Duty of Care
   obligations remain and the absence of reasonable measures to prevent
   incidents may undermine an employee’s health and security and
   compromise the organisation’s performance.

The impact of overlooking your Duty of Care responsibilities

   Legal ramifications have historically accounted for the primary concern
   of overlooking Duty of Care responsibilities. In a broader sense, the
   lack of demonstration to protect employees has also resulted in
   reputational damage, loss of productivity, increased employee turnover
   as well as overall cost.

   As negligent cases take over the headlines of global news networks, the
   awareness of Duty of Care has been made apparent on a global scale. The
   COVID-19 pandemic played an important part in this heightened
   awareness, especially from the viewpoint of employees. Growing concerns
   and expectations from employees have been brought to the fore,
   requesting more from their employers when it comes to proactively
   protecting their health, safety, security and wellbeing. Organisations
   seen to not open dialogue to their employees’ needs have also faced
   public repercussions.

Responsibilities of an employer

   As an organisation that employs a workforce operating in varying
   environments, demonstrating your Duty of Care responsibilities should
   be at the core of your corporate policies.
   Although the legal specifications may vary based on location, size and
   industry, our experts have outlined the critical responsibilities
   employers need to consider in 2023:
     * Taking ownership of the concept of Duty of Care: A solid
       understanding of the theory around Duty of Care is essential.
       Nevertheless, for an effective and viable implementation within
       one’s organisation, the latter must take ownership of the concept
       of Duty of Care. To do so, they must consider their organisation’s
       specificities for a bespoke application. These will help determine
       the scope of Duty of Care.
     * Know the typology of your organisation (SME, MNC, NGO, etc.) - know
       your human, tangible, and intangible assets, your footprint around
       the world, current and future developments/expansion projects, the
       types of risks the organisation is exposed to/may be exposed to.
     * Understand your corporate culture: the resulting policies must be
       in harmony with the corporate culture, which is defined by
       attitudes, values and practices. This will ease adhesion by both
       staff and senior management, creating a virtuous cycle for
       acceptance, and implementation.
     * Determine the demographics covered: While it may be obvious for
       many to cover all employees, question whether interns, contractors,
       digital nomads are fully covered and integrated in your policies.
     * Map and navigate the various internal stakeholders that will
       inevitably engage with Duty of Care considerations (employees,
       direct managers, security managers, HR, international mobility,
       legal, purchasing, risk manager, insurance, etc.).
     * Have the support of your top management: Top management must be
       convinced by the importance and the benefits of having a robust
       Duty of Care policy in place. To gain their support, they must
       understand what the risks are of not having a policy in place, what
       other organisations in the same industry are doing and how success
       will be measured.
     * Understanding your employees’ risks: A workforce, regardless of
       size, is likely to be diverse. That diversity can create varying
       risk profiles which as an employer, you should be aware of. Through
       open communication methods, transparency and trust, your employees
       should understand the intent, and benefit of sharing their
       individualistic demographics from health risks to pre-existing
       conditions or sexual orientation and feel safe to do so. In
       addition, the risk profiles of your employees will drastically
       change based on the location they work in or travel to, and need to
       be mitigated accordingly.
     * Proactive education and training: Once you have a broad
       understanding of your employees’ risk profiles, offering the
       respective education and training is key to empowering effective
       decision making. Whether through email, webinars, digital training,
       workshops, bulletins or events, your employees should have multiple
       touch points to understand how to best mitigate risks and where to
       find the necessary information. They should also be aware of the
       organisation’s policies and how to raise questions and concerns.
     * Duty of Care in crisis: Although Duty of Care responsibilities
       should exist on a day-to-day basis, they become all the more
       critical in times of crisis. When time is of the essence, the
       immediate objective is to know if your people are in the impacted
       location and if they are safe. The importance of tracking and
       communicating with your employees plays a key role in a crisis
       management response.
     * Review, revise and re-assess: As Duty of Care obligations are
       spread across departments, the revision of corporate policies and
       procedures should take place on a predefined and regular basis and
       in collaboration with internal and, where relevant, external
       stakeholders. There should be fluidity in your Duty of Care
       framework as your workforce, operations and global environment of
       operations change.

The future of Duty of Care

   As the risks to employees evolve, so too will the Duty of Care
   responsibilities of employers. As pandemics, global security incidents
   and economic pressures rise, risk prevention measures need to remain
   coherent.
   Although the frequency and volatility of these incidents may continue
   to rise, the foundational Duty of Care responsibilities still apply.
   The demonstration by an organisation to protect their people from harm,
   both physical and psychological, will maintain precedence.

   A rise in employee expectations will likely persist as flexible working
   patterns, remote working and extended benefits become the new norm.
   After the times of the great resignation, the needs of employees are
   being more widely heard and feedback mechanisms put in place.

Best practices and recommendations

     * Carry out a regular risk assessment, especially if opening new
       operations in a location or sending employees abroad.
     * Communicate regularly and often with your employees to instil
       confidence and peace of mind.
     * Engage with an assistance provider to enable your organisation to
       protect the health, safety, security and wellbeing of your people
       on a 24/7 basis. With a global footprint, and on-the-ground
       expertise, they can advise and support your employees, regardless
       of location.
     * Invest in digital tools to leverage tracking, monitoring and
       information. Utilising an app for your employees to access the
       latest health and security information, sends the most relevant
       location-based alerts and identifies and communicates with
       vulnerable employees in times of crisis.
