   Sara Rosen, DDS, recalls the moment when she realized she wanted to
   become an oral and maxillofacial surgeon. It was during her general
   practice residency (GPR) at Monmouth Medical Center.

   “I had a lot of surgical opportunities during my GPR,” related Dr.
   Rosen, a 2021 graduate of Touro College of Dental Medicine and
   president of the school’s second class of graduates. “I was assisting
   during a facial reconstruction case in the operating room and we were
   working on a patient with special needs who had some very complex
   craniofacial deformity. She had suffered serious child abuse and was
   helpless. She couldn’t speak so we needed to figure out how to help
   her. I knew then I was going to pursue oral and maxillofacial surgery.
   No one should have had to suffer like this poor girl.”

   Oral and maxillofacial surgery is a notoriously rigorous and difficult
   profession, but Dr. Rosen’s friendly demeanor masks hard-driving
   determination and an almost steel will. Dr. Rosen credits some of her
   persistence to her first love: ballet. She spent twenty years as a
   competitive ballerina before opting to pursue psychology and pre-med
   studies while a student at Rutgers University.

   “I realized that no matter how good of a ballerina I was, my career
   shelf-life would be quite short,” said Dr. Rosen. “I would probably be
   somewhat retired by now.”

   Dr. Rosen considered pursuing medicine like her father, an internal
   medicine & infectious disease specialist, but decided on dentistry
   after working with him.

   “I was helping in my father’s practice, and I met with one of his
   patients who suffered from a heart valve infection caused by
   periodontal disease,” recalled Dr. Rosen. “Until then, I didn’t realize
   how much your oral health can affect your systematic health. That
   ultimately translated for me into pursuing dentistry.”

   With a stellar GPA and DAT score, Dr. Rosen had her pick of dental
   schools. But she chose Touro.

   “My father is an alumnus of Touro University’s New York Medical
   College,” she said. “When I interviewed at Touro it felt like home.”

   Dr. Rosen quickly became a star as a member of Touro College of Dental
   Medicine’s second class and served as the class president. She formed
   close relationships with her peers and her professors.

   “Our clinical education was outstanding, especially in how it
   transitioned to residency and practice,” said Dr. Rosen. “I felt a lot
   more prepared than my peers.”

   Halfway through her GPR, she applied for an internship in oral and
   maxillofacial facial surgery at Montefiore Medical Center. While at
   Montefiore, Dr. Rosen decided to fulfill a lifelong dream of joining
   the military and she applied for an oral and maxillofacial surgery
   residency at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii. “My family is very
   patriotic, and several relatives have served,” she said. As part of her
   commission, she enters the military as a captain. She will be training
   in residency for four years and will then work as a military surgeon
   for another four. Currently, she is in an officer commissioning course
   in Oklahoma. After another nine-week basic officer learning course, she
   will report for duty at Tripler.

   As for future dental students, Dr. Rosen had the following advice:

   “Try to get as much experience as you can in each specialty,” she said.
   “You might experience something that will make you want to change the
   path you’re on, and experience in each specialty will make you a better
   practitioner. Get to know your professors because they’re ultimately
   the ones investing in your future and will be there supporting you
   along the ride. Stay active and have some good friends by your side.”
