   The Consumer Duty will set higher and clearer standards of consumer
   protection across financial services and require firms to act to
   deliver good outcomes for customers. We set out here the findings from
   our review of firms’ plans to embed the Duty within their businesses.

1. Why we conducted this review

   In July 2022, we set out the [141]final rules and [142]guidance for a
   new Consumer Duty. The Consumer Duty is a cornerstone of our three-year
   strategy and a key element of our work to set and test higher
   standards.

   The rules and guidance we are introducing come into force on a phased
   basis:
     * for new and existing products or services that are open to sale or
       renewal the rules come into force on 31 July 2023
     * for closed products or services, the rules come into force on 31
       July 2024

   In our [143]Policy Statement, we said we want firms to make full use of
   the implementation period to embed the Duty effectively. We also said
   we would support firms’ work by feeding back useful insights on what we
   see in the market. We set out our expectation that by the end of
   October 2022, firms’ boards (or equivalent management body) should have
   agreed their plans for implementing the Duty and be able to evidence
   they have scrutinised and challenged their plans to ensure they are
   deliverable and robust enough to meet the new standards.

   We have reviewed the implementation plans of larger ‘fixed’ firms,
   which have a dedicated supervision team at the FCA, where we believe
   they are substantially in scope of the Duty. We did this to better
   understand firms’ approach to embedding the Duty within their
   businesses. As well as engaging with individual firms directly, we are
   publishing findings from this review to help all firms understand our
   expectations and implement the Duty more effectively.

2. Who this applies to

   The findings from this review are likely to interest:
     * regulated firms preparing for the Consumer Duty to come into force

     * industry groups/trade bodies
     * industry experts and commentators

3. What we did

3.1. The firms in our review

   After the end of October 2022 milestone, we requested the Consumer Duty
   implementation plans from larger fixed firms with a dedicated FCA
   supervision team, who primarily operate in retail financial services
   markets. These are the firms with the greatest potential impact on
   consumers and markets.

   Whilst our findings are primarily drawn from our reading of these
   plans, in some cases our views are supplemented by what we have learned
   from discussing the plans with firms or by asking questions during the
   course of our regular supervisory engagement.

3.2. What we sought to establish

   We reviewed these implementation plans to better understand firms’
   approach to embedding the Duty within their businesses. We considered a
   range of different factors, including:
     * Firms’ approach to governance and arrangements for ongoing
       oversight of their implementation work.
     * The deliverability of firms’ plans, and their ability to meet the
       implementation deadline.
     * Assessing firms’ understanding of, and engagement with, third party
       providers where firms are dependent on third parties to implement
       their plans.
     * How far plans address the substantive requirements of the Duty as
       set out in our final rules and guidance. This includes the four
       outcome areas involving products and services, price and value,
       consumer understanding and consumer support.
     * Firms’ data strategies to ensure they will be able to identify,
       monitor, evidence and stand behind the outcomes their customers
       experience.
     * Firms’ culture and people strategies to ensure their business will
       be focused on delivering good outcomes for consumers and that all
       staff understand their responsibilities under the Duty.

4. What we found

4.1. Summary of findings and implications for firms

   We welcome all firms’ efforts to respond to the Consumer Duty and make
   the changes needed to meet the new standards within the implementation
   period. This review adds to our understanding of the progress that the
   industry is making as a whole.

   Many of the plans we reviewed showed that firms have understood and
   embraced the shift to focus on consumer outcomes, established extensive
   programmes of work to embed the Duty, and are engaging with the
   substantive requirements, including the four outcome areas. We are
   convinced this will bring benefits for both consumers and firms.

   However, we did also identify plans that suggested some firms may be
   further behind in their thinking and planning for the Duty. This brings
   a risk that they may not be ready in time, or they may struggle to
   embed the Duty effectively throughout their business.

   We know that the plans we reviewed can only give us a snapshot of
   firms’ planning at one point of time. Many firms will have work in
   place that was not reflected in these high-level plans or will have
   progressed their work further since then. However, this review gives us
   an important overview of progress in large firms, and a benchmark for
   our ongoing engagement with those firms as we work to ensure they embed
   the Duty effectively.

   Through our review we have identified many examples of good practice,
   and also examples where firms may need to improve their implementation
   approach. We think all firms will find these examples useful, as they
   will help them better understand our expectations and recalibrate and
   improve their embedding work where necessary.

   Our review has highlighted three key areas where firms should
   particularly focus their attention during the second half of the
   implementation period (to 31 July 2023):
     * Effective prioritisation: We saw some plans where it was not clear
       what the basis was for prioritising some implementation work ahead
       of other aspects. Firms should make sure they are prioritising
       appropriately, focusing on reducing the risk of poor consumer
       outcomes and assessing where they are likely to be furthest away
       from the requirements of the Duty.
     * Embedding the substantive requirements: We recognise plans were
       likely to be high level given the early stage at which we reviewed
       them. Nevertheless, we saw some plans that suggested firms may have
       considered the requirements superficially or are over-confident
       that their existing policies and processes will be adequate. We
       urge firms to carefully consider the substantive requirements of
       the Duty, as set out in our final rules and guidance. Firms should
       ensure that, when they are reviewing their products and services,
       communications and customer journeys, they identify and make the
       changes needed to meet the new standards.
     * Working with other firms: To implement the Duty on time, many firms
       need to work and share information with other firms in the
       distribution chain. However, we found some plans which gave little
       focus to this area. This suggests some firms may need to accelerate
       their work on this important aspect of implementation.

   As they oversee the implementation of the Duty, firms’ boards and
   management bodies will want to particularly focus and provide challenge
   in the three areas above, as well as the wider points in the ‘key
   findings’ section below.

5. Next steps

   As set out above, firms should consider the findings from our review,
   and develop their implementation plans and approach in line with good
   practice where appropriate.

   We will continue our work to support firms’ embedding activities in the
   run-up to the July 2023 implementation deadline for new and existing
   products and services:
     * We will continue to engage with fixed firms where we have questions
       about their plans or approach, and to monitor the progress they are
       making in embedding the Duty. We will also be working with and
       supporting board champions at some larger firms.
     * We will soon be sending a survey to a sample of firms to help us
       understand the progress they are making in implementing the Duty
       and will carry out targeted engagement with smaller firms.
     * We will shortly be issuing letters to firms, highlighting our key
       expectations on implementing the Duty and some of the key risks and
       consumer harms we are concerned about in their sectors.
     * Our programme of communications on the Duty will continue, for
       example, with further updates to our dedicated [144]webpages and a
       series of [145]regional in-person events for specific groups of
       small and medium-sized firms.

6. Key findings

   We set out further detail on our findings below. Where we reference
   good practice on this page, these are positive examples we have found
   from our review work. Under the heading ‘areas for improvement’, we
   cite practices and examples we identified in our review where firms may
   need to develop their approach further to ensure they meet expectations
   under the Duty when it comes into force. Our supervisors are also
   providing feedback to individual firms, where appropriate.

6.1. Governance and oversight

   Under the Duty, we will be holding firms – including their senior
   managers and boards – accountable for delivering good outcomes for
   consumers. We want to see senior leaders in firms driving the changes
   needed to meet the Duty standard.

   We have set an expectation that firms appoint a Consumer Duty champion
   at board or equivalent level. This is not a ‘prescribed responsibility’
   under the Senior Managers & Certification Regime (SM&CR). Instead, this
   champion role is to support the Chair and CEO in raising the Duty in
   all relevant discussions and to challenge the firm’s management on how
   it is embedding the Duty and focusing on consumer outcomes. Our rules
   also make clear that we expect customer outcomes to be a key focus for
   important areas, such as risk and internal audit functions.

   Chapter 10 of our [146]Finalised Guidance gives more information on our
   expectations in this area.

Good practice

     * Many firms have developed robust governance frameworks for their
       implementation work, with clear executive accountability for
       delivery and board oversight.
     * We identified evidence that plans had been scrutinised and
       challenged by firms’ boards, executives and their audit and risk
       functions. For example, through questioning resource requirements
       and interaction with other ongoing project work. In one example, a
       firm is delivering one-to-one deep dive sessions with board members
       on plan deliverables.
     * Most firms have appointed a Consumer Duty board champion at an
       appropriate level to ensure that the Duty is discussed in a
       meaningful way. We identified an example where a firm with a large
       group structure has appointed two champions to reflect the
       diversity of its different regulated entities.
     * Many plans detailed clear arrangements for ongoing scrutiny of
       their firm’s implementation work by the board, executive and their
       audit and risk functions. For example, by making the Duty a
       standing agenda item at key governance forums and through plans for
       independent reviews of implementation work by risk and compliance
       or internal audit functions.
     * We also saw evidence of firms involving risk and compliance and
       internal audit teams in a timely way. This included:
          + frank assessments by these teams of current risks to
            successful and timely delivery
          + assurance of the effectiveness of controls in place over Duty
            implementation
          + planned assurance work before the deadline on implementation,
            with immediate and further assurance work planned after the
            deadline
     * Some firms have established central coordinating forums to drive
       consistency in interpreting the Duty across different business
       functions, or for coordinating required changes to systems and
       technology across workstreams.

Areas for improvement

     * We identified plans that gave little detail on who is leading the
       overall implementation programme and is responsible for it, or who
       is leading the various workstreams within the programme.
     * In some cases, there was more limited evidence that firms’ boards
       and committees had properly scrutinised and challenged plans. In
       one example, there was no evidence of engagement with the firm’s
       Chair or other non-executive directors, and the board only asked
       one question before approving the plan. In another example, board
       minutes showed that the plan was approved without discussion.
     * Some plans gave no timings, even tentatively, for when progress
       updates on the implementation programme would be provided to key
       governance bodies, including the board.
     * Some firms have been slow to appoint a Consumer Duty board
       champion. In one example, a champion was proposed who did not
       appear sufficiently senior to provide confidence they would be able
       to effectively challenge the firm’s approach to implementing the
       Duty.
     * A small number of firms did not propose an individual champion or
       champions but suggested that the role be shared across the entire
       board or executive. While we have not been prescriptive on the
       champion role, as we want firms to implement this in a way that is
       effective for their business, this is not what we intended and our
       view is this will not be an effective approach given the extent it
       is likely to dilute the role.
     * Some firms did not include a summary opinion from risk and
       compliance or internal audit teams on their implementation plan and
       its risks or chances of meeting the deadline.
     * Some plans suggested firms need to further develop their approach
       on how they will engage with the board and executive
       post-implementation to provide ongoing assurance that they are
       meeting expectations under the Duty.

6.2. Culture and people

   The higher standards of the Duty and the shift to focusing on consumer
   outcomes will require a significant change in many firms’ culture.

   Firms should ensure that the interests of their customers are central
   to their culture and purpose and that this is embedded throughout the
   organisation. This means strategies, leadership and people policies
   (including incentives at all levels) lead to good outcomes for
   customers. Individual accountability and high standards of personal
   conduct in firms will ensure that firms are meeting their obligations
   under the Duty.

   Chapter 10 of our [147]Finalised Guidance gives more information on our
   expectations in this area.

Good practice

     * Some plans set out a clear people and training approach to ensure
       all staff understand their responsibilities under the Duty.
       Different approaches were proposed to engage staff, including
       all-staff and role-tailored training, internal communications
       campaigns and awareness-raising through company town hall meetings.
       One firm noted that it had delivered interactive training on the
       Duty to its board.
     * One firm set out plans to explain its purpose and values in a way
       aligned with delivering good consumer outcomes, updating internal
       cultural and training materials to reflect this as appropriate.
       Another firm detailed how it will embed the Duty in its strategy,
       governance structure and decision making.
     * Some plans confirmed firms will review reward and incentive
       structures and performance management frameworks at all levels to
       ensure they reflect the Duty. One firm noted it plans to
       incorporate the Duty within the design of its staff performance
       scorecard. Others explained that their SMCR regime will be updated
       to include the Duty, with senior leaders expected to lead the
       cultural change needed.

Areas for improvement

     * Other plans were lacking in detail in this area, with limited
       information about how the Duty will be embedded in firms’ culture
       and people approach.
     * In some cases, plans recognised the importance of a culture focused
       on delivering good customer outcomes but provided little
       explanation of tangible action the firm needs to take to ensure
       this is the case. These plans gave no evidence of any consideration
       of how far their firm’s current purpose, culture and values do, or
       do not, align with the Duty, or how improvements in those would be
       made.

6.3. Deliverability

   Embedding the Duty is a complex task. We recognised this in extending
   and phasing the implementation period. So, it is essential that firms
   continue to develop and monitor robust implementation plans to make the
   changes needed to meet our expectations when the Duty comes into
   force.

   We expect firms to have carried out analysis for all relevant areas of
   their business to scope the work required, set out clear workstreams
   and milestones with appropriate resource and documented key risks,
   mitigation strategies and dependences.

Good practice

     * Most firms have effectively set out key workstreams, with some
       clearly mapping the milestones they need to meet to have a
       realistic prospect of meeting the implementation deadline. In one
       example, a firm had allocated specific workstreams based on the
       structure of the Duty and its requirements as set out in our final
       rules and guidance. Each workstream included a clear breakdown of
       deliverables, milestones, and target completion dates with a
       framework for tracking progress.
     * It was typical to see firms break down their implementation
       programmes into workstreams aimed directly at the Duty’s four
       outcomes and closely related considerations like vulnerability.
       Other workstreams were aimed at key ‘enablers’ such as policies and
       standards, consumer journeys and processes, data and monitoring,
       and cultural embedding and training.
     * Some plans gave a clear account of how the implementation programme
       and its workstreams range across, and are being taken forward in,
       different parts of the business, or entities within the firm or
       group structure.
     * Some firms have clearly committed resource that matches the scale
       of uplift and challenges presented by implementing the Duty. We
       noted examples where firms have identified early, and in detail,
       any resource shortfalls for timely implementation – especially in
       areas like technology – and have a commitment and plan to address
       this. Some firms are investing sensibly in support and advice from
       external experts where this assists and adds value.
     * Some firms had considered how their Consumer Duty implementation
       work aligns with other ongoing change initiatives or strategic
       programmes. They considered alignment and differences, as well as
       highlighting any dependencies and bottlenecks of timing or
       resource.
     * Many firms had set out key delivery risks. The most effective
       examples of this provided an adequate explanation of the risk,
       proposed mitigation strategies, assigned owners and confirmed plans
       to track these in relevant governance forums and committees.
     * Some firms set out a sensible approach to prioritise or triage
       implementation work. This approach was based on an initial
       assessment of where they believe they have most work to do to meet
       the Duty standard and there is greatest potential for poor consumer
       outcomes. For example, we saw plans that recognised where certain
       parts of the business may be starting from further back in their
       journey towards implementing the Duty. Others identified and ranked
       in a reasoned and consistent way the products or services, customer
       journeys and communications which present higher risk of harm under
       the Duty. They then prioritised these for detailed review or gap
       analysis against the Duty outcomes.
     * We found evidence of firms seeking to pragmatically meet the
       challenge of timely implementation by taking more agile or flexible
       approaches. For example, by progressing workstreams in parallel
       rather than sequentially, or by pressing ahead with partial fixes
       on a ‘no regrets’ basis, where potential improvements have been
       identified, even if the whole picture is still unclear. Some firms
       have a clear view of what may require tactical fixes by the
       deadline and what may need fuller strategic solutions
       subsequently.

Areas for improvement

     * Some firms’ implementation work appears to be less progressed than
       others with gap analyses at an earlier stage and project
       requirements yet to be fully scoped. We identified examples where
       timelines seemed unclear, or sequencing confused. Some did not give
       any indication of the number or proportion of products, services,
       communications and customer journeys covered by their work plan, or
       of their respective assessment of risks or priorities.
     * Some firms’ approach to prioritising implementation work seemed
       less clearly based on an assessment of the potential for poor
       consumer outcomes. In one example, a firm said it intended to focus
       on ‘signature actions’ but it was unclear what these were or how
       they were decided. Another plan noted that the firm would only be
       able to address material findings by the deadline but gave no
       account of what it would regard or define as material in that
       context.
     * In some cases, risks and internal and external dependencies were
       not clearly set out, with apparently little thought given to
       mitigation strategies. Some firms may need to give further
       consideration to their resource planning, as they provided limited
       information in this area. In one example, a firm noted resource is
       stretched but did not provide clear ways of managing this. In
       another example, most implementation work appeared to be allocated
       to staff on top of their existing roles with limited dedicated
       resource. Other plans noted a shortfall in budget or technology
       resource but without setting out plans for addressing this.

6.4. Third parties

   The Duty applies to all firms with a key role in delivering retail
   customer outcomes, including those with no direct customer
   relationship. It will be essential for firms to work together across
   distribution chains to deliver good outcomes for the end retail
   customer.

   Firms should therefore be considering where and how they work with
   third parties to deliver products and services to customers, and make
   sure these arrangements will meet expectations under the Duty. This
   includes other firms in the distribution chain and where firms
   outsource the delivery of services to other parties. In particular,
   manufacturers and distributors will need to work together and share
   information. To help ensure this happens, we have set a milestone for
   the end of April 2023 for manufacturers to complete all reviews
   necessary to meet the four outcome rules and share information with
   distributors to allow them to meet their obligations.

   Chapter 2 of our [148]Finalised Guidance explains how the Duty applies
   across the distribution chain. Chapter 6 gives examples of the type of
   information we would expect to be shared between firms, where
   appropriate.

Good practice

     * Some firms appeared to have a good understanding of implementation
       dependencies with third party providers and had allocated time in
       their plan for this work. We identified one example where a firm
       had set a cross-outcome objective to work with partners in a
       transparent way to ensure cooperation and that Duty requirements
       are met. Other examples included:
          + a firm working with a key supplier on a framework for
            engagement on the Duty
          + detail of a firm’s extensive engagement with a critical
            supplier to shape its plan
          + face-to-face workshops arranged by one firm with its third
            party agents to design their approach
          + a firm that included a workstream to assess relevant contracts
            and plans so they could embed change requirements into
            renegotiations at the earliest opportunity

Areas for improvement

     * Other firms’ work appeared less developed in this area. Some
       recognised that they do work with third parties – and that they
       would need to consider this – but did not specifically identify key
       third party relationships or the nature of any dependency. In some
       cases, it was also unclear what, if any, engagement had taken place
       or was planned with relevant third parties. Some firms showed
       limited consideration in their plan timetable of the need to engage
       and, where appropriate, exchange information with third parties in
       a timely way.


6.5. The four outcomes

   We expect the Consumer Duty to improve outcomes for consumers in all
   areas of business between firms and customers. The Duty’s four outcomes
   cover the key elements of the firm-consumer relationship.

   The Duty means consumers should get communications they can understand,
   products and services that meet their needs and offer fair value, and
   they get the customer support they need, when they need it.

   Firms should carefully consider the substantive requirements set out in
   our final rules and guidance (including Chapters 4 to 9 of our
   [149]Finalised Guidance), identify where they fall short, and make the
   changes necessary to their products, communications, systems and
   processes to meet the Duty standard.

Good practice

   Some plans were clearer than others that firms had engaged with the
   substantive requirements of the Duty and considered what these mean for
   their businesses and the changes they will likely need to make. The
   most effective plans in this area attempted to define good customer
   outcomes in the context of their business and considered how to deliver
   these through improvements to their products and services,
   communications and the support they provide. Firms set out plans to
   build on and uplift existing frameworks around product governance,
   product value assessments and the clarity of communications as
   appropriate. For example:

Products & Services

     * Some firms had clearly identified the number of open and closed
       products that they hold and carried out an initial exercise to
       prioritise for review those with greatest risk of causing consumer
       harm. For example, one firm identified several specific products in
       its range that present a risk of poor outcomes to a certain group
       of customers and has prioritised these, with a clear path for
       making the required improvements.
     * Some firms had identified where they will need to build on existing
       product governance and assessment frameworks to meet the new
       requirements under the Duty. For example, one firm acknowledged
       that it needs to collect greater granularity of information to
       ensure the design and management of its products and services is
       aligned to the needs, objectives and characteristics of customers
       in the target market. Another firm explained it is developing a
       product level management dashboard with metrics to monitor the
       performance of its products.

Price & Value

     * It was clear that some firms are considering what fair value means
       in the context of their business models, products, services and
       customers. For example, one firm noted that a full value chain
       analysis is in progress, and it has identified areas where value
       can be improved. A different firm explained it is giving particular
       focus to making sure there are no hidden or unexpected costs for
       customers.
     * Several firms explained they are considering how their current
       approach needs to change to deliver good outcomes for consumers.
       For example, one firm noted it has a fair value framework, but this
       needs to evolve to better consider non-price factors and ensure
       there is a reasonable relationship between costs and benefits to
       meet Duty requirements. Another firm noted that it has new pricing
       models under development. Similarly, one firm recognised that its
       product pricing structure may need to change to address an issue it
       has identified in relation to high fees.
     * We identified plans where clearer consideration is being given to
       whether products and services offer fair value to different groups
       of customers, including those with characteristics of vulnerability
       or with protected characteristics.

Consumer Understanding

     * Some plans showed firms are carefully considering how to give
       customers the information they need, at the right time, and
       presented in a way they can understand to make effective decisions.
       In one example, a firm explained that it is developing new
       communication standards, including consideration of reading age,
       comprehensibility, visual accessibility and layout. Some plans
       specified actions firms are taking, including ensuring product
       terms and conditions are explained in simple language and available
       in other languages, and websites clearly set out cancellation
       rights and how to make a complaint.
     * It was clearer in some plans that firms are considering their
       different communications channels. For example, one firm noted it
       is making improvements to its call centre scripts to better support
       customers with the information it provides. Another firm noted its
       intention to review the consistency of information provided to
       customers by its distributors.
     * Some firms noted they are developing greater communications testing
       capability to support good customer outcomes. For example, one firm
       set out plans to carry out testing of communications pre-release,
       post-release and on existing content. Another firm explained it has
       developed a range of options for suitable testing depending on
       different risk factors. Similarly, one firm recognised that
       differences in the complexity of products means that a more
       tailored approach could be appropriate in some areas.
     * A number of plans detailed metrics firms will use to measure
       consumer understanding. For example, one firm noted it will
       incorporate marketing data and customer behaviour into its ongoing
       monitoring activity. Other firms cited different metrics they plan
       to capture going forward, including the percentage of customer
       facing content being tested and the percentage of customers who
       take the expected action after communication.

Consumer Support

     * Some plans more clearly set out the customer outcomes they want
       their support processes to deliver, with firms making commitments
       including to ensure call waiting times are not unreasonably long
       and the quality of support provided is monitored.
     * Some firms identified specific customer journeys that need to be
       improved to better support customers in vulnerable circumstances,
       including new mechanisms for customers to notify the firm of any
       additional needs or vulnerability. For example, one firm explained
       it is giving particular focus to bereavement, fraud and complaints
       processes.
     * It was clear that some firms are considering their support channel
       approach. For example, one firm set out plans to provide
       information to customers via their channel of choice and in ways
       that better support good decision-making. Another firm noted it is
       planning new and expanded support channels for its customers.
     * Some firms explained they are considering steps in their support
       processes and whether these help or hinder the delivery of good
       customer outcomes. For example, one firm explained that work has
       started to review customer journeys and improvements have already
       been made impacting several of its product lines. The firm has
       prioritised remaining journeys using a risk-based approach, with
       further improvements planned where any barriers to good customer
       outcomes are identified.
     * Several firms cited different metrics they will collect to monitor
       they are delivering the support their customers need, including
       call waiting times, resolution times, first contact resolution
       rates, call transfer accuracy metrics and quality and complaints
       themes.

Areas for improvement

     * Given the high-level nature of many plans at time of review, there
       was more limited evidence in some plans of how firms have engaged
       with the substantive requirements of the Duty. For example, plans
       included high-level actions such as ‘review customer-focused
       policies and procedures to ensure they capture and reference the
       requirements of the Duty’ and ‘assess whether existing products
       deliver fair value’. This type of task-based description gave no
       indication of how firms have interpreted the Duty’s requirements
       and considered the challenges of how they will apply them to their
       businesses, or the consumer outcomes they are aiming to deliver.
     * Other plans seemed rather complacent about past improvements,
       initiatives or current frameworks, and their adequacy for meeting
       the Duty or for putting the firm in a good position to do so.
     * In several cases, it was unclear exactly what methodology or
       approach the firm will use in its reviews or gap analyses of
       products, services, communications and customer journeys against
       the Duty outcomes. Similarly, it was unclear how some firms will
       amend and uplift existing assessment frameworks to meet the Duty
       standard. If firms are behind in their thinking about how exactly
       to conduct these reviews and gap exercises effectively, they risk
       being behind in their planning of how long such exercises will
       likely take.


6.6. Data strategies

   A key part of the Duty is that firms assess, test, understand and
   evidence the outcomes their customers are receiving. Without this, it
   will be impossible for firms to know that they are meeting the
   requirements set out in the Consumer Duty.

   The type of information firms will use will vary depending on factors
   like size, client base and the types of products and services they
   offer.

    Firms will need to use their judgement to identify data sources as
   evidence against the outcomes of the Duty. Chapter 11 of
   our [150]Finalised Guidance gives examples of the types of data firms
   could collect.

Good practice

     * Firms that had considered the consumer outcomes they are aiming to
       deliver also tended to have considered the data they need to
       measure and monitor the delivery of these outcomes.
     * Some firms had clearly carried out exploratory work to understand
       the data and metrics available across their businesses and set out
       plans to bring these together, as well as any remaining gaps in
       their Consumer Duty data requirements.
     * Some firms set out longer-term strategic aims to advance the
       functionality of their systems and data collection, but also
       shorter-term solutions to evidence and monitor that Duty
       requirements are being met and customers are receiving good
       outcomes.

Areas for improvement

     * Not all plans clearly explained the data required to monitor
       compliance with the Duty. Some plans offered more limited detail of
       firms’ in-depth consideration of their data requirements under the
       Duty and how they will source, package, monitor, govern, and act
       upon these.
     * In some cases, firms’ data strategies seemed to be largely based on
       repackaging existing data, with limited consideration of gaps or
       the outcomes it is intended to monitor. If firms assume they can
       ‘get by’ largely with repackaging or supplementing existing data,
       then they risk not thinking deeply or afresh about the types and
       granularity of data that they will actually need to monitor and
       evidence outcomes under the Duty effectively.
     * In some plans there appeared to be more limited consideration of
       how firms will monitor outcomes for different groups of customers,
       including those in vulnerable circumstances.
