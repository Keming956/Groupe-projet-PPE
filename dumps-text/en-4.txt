Special Duties & Other Assignments

SPECIAL DUTIES. EXTRAORDINARY ROLES.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Marines often serve in a variety of special capacities, whether
   protecting our Nation’s embassies abroad, recruiting the next
   generation of United States Marines, or even serving the United States
   Special Operations Command as a MARSOC Raider. These duties are earned
   by Marines who have proven their exceptional ability to fight and win
   in the primary [56]Military Occupational Specialties (MOSs).
     __________________________________________________________________

BEYOND THE CALL OF NORMAL DUTY.

   Every Marine takes on a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) for which
   he or she is optimally trained, but beyond these roles are the
   opportunities to take on special duty assignments. Many of these
   advanced opportunities are called “B” Billets, a designation separate
   from a Marine’s primary MOS. Explore these critical but atypical roles
   in the Corps.

RECRUITING DUTY

   Recruiting duty is a vital assignment in the Marine Corps, as it puts
   Marines in the position of ensuring the standards of our Corps remain
   high. Those Marines selected for recruiting duty carry the essential
   duty of screening, selecting, and preparing the next generation of
   Marines for the physical and mental rigors of recruit training.
     __________________________________________________________________

DRILL INSTRUCTOR DUTY

   Those Marines selected to serve on Drill Instructor Duty carry the
   essential responsibility of directly shaping the future of the Marine
   Corps, providing guidance, discipline, and direction for future
   Marines.
     __________________________________________________________________

     “These recruits are entrusted to my care. I will train them to the
     best of my ability. I will develop them into smartly disciplined,
     physically fit, basically trained Marines, thoroughly indoctrinated
     in love of Corps and country. I will demand of them, and demonstrate
     by my own example, the highest standards of personal conduct,
     morality and professional skill."

     —Excerpt from Drill Instructor's Creed

MARINE SECURITY GUARD/EMBASSY DUTY

   The Marine Corps is the only military service that is entrusted with
   the responsibility of providing security for U.S. Embassies and
   Consulates around the world. Marines selected for these special duty
   assignments will have the opportunity to serve at embassies and
   consulates located in various countries around the globe.
     __________________________________________________________________

SECURITY FORCES

   Security Force duty is among the most challenging the Corps offers, and
   Marines who take on this opportunity must be highly-trained in advanced
   security procedures. Our Nation places special trusts in these Marines,
   as they are assigned the responsibility of maintaining a worldwide
   presence, guarding and protecting key naval assets and special
   strategic weapons.
     __________________________________________________________________

MARINE CORPS SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND

   Ready to stand on the frontline of any battle, the Marine Raiders of
   MARSOC are built up in their Corps ethos, warfighting philosophy and
   values and represent the Marine Corps contribution to the United States
   Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). Two of the prominent roles within
   the Marine Raider community include Critical Skills Operators, who
   support the full spectrum of special operations on a global scale, and
   Special Operations Capability Specialists, who provide combat support
   expertise in intelligence, fire support, communications, EOD, and
   canine operations.
