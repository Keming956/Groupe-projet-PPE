TARIC

   TARIC, the integrated Tariff of the European Union, is a multilingual
   database integrating all measures relating to EU customs tariff,
   commercial and agricultural legislation.

   ACCESS THE DATABASE

   Integrating and coding these measures facilitates their uniform
   application by all Member States and gives all economic operators a
   clear view of measures to be taken when importing goods into the EU or
   exporting goods from the EU.

   It also makes it possible to collect EU-wide statistics for the
   concerned measures.

   Daily transmissions of TARIC data via an electronic network guarantee
   immediate and correct information for the national administrations of
   the Member States, who use this data mainly to feed their national
   systems for customs clearance, with the goal of maximising automatic
   customs clearance.

Legal basis

   The legal base of the TARIC is Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of
   23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the
   Common Customs Tariff (Official Journal L 256, 07/09/1987).

Main categories of measures (Non exhaustive list):

     * Tariff measures
          + "Third country duty”, customs duty applicable to all imports
            originating in a non-EU country/territory, as defined in the
            Combined Nomenclature
          + Tariff preferences
          + Autonomous tariff suspensions
          + Tariff quotas
          + Customs Unions
     * Agricultural measures
          + Agricultural components
          + Additional duties on sugar, on sugar content and on flour
            content
          + Representative prices for poultry
          + Standard Import Values and Unit Prices for fruits and
            vegetables
     * Trade Defence instruments
          + Antidumping duties and countervailing duties
          + Safeguard measures
     * Prohibitions and restrictions to import and export
          + Import and/or export prohibition of certain goods (e.g.:
            ozone-depleting substances, certain products originating in or
            exported to some countries/territories like Iran, North Korea,
            etc.)
          + Quantitative limits
          + Import and/or export controls of certain categories of goods
            (e.g. products subject to CITES, luxury goods, cultural goods,
            products and equipment containing fluorinated greenhouse
            gases, dual use goods, veterinary or phytosanitary controls on
            animals and food, etc.)
     * Surveillance of movements of goods at import and export

TARIC also contains

     * The goods nomenclature and the additional codes;
     * The supplementary units;
     * The EU codes to be used in Data Element 2/3 of the Customs
       Declaration as "Documents produced, certificates and
       authorisations, additional references" (previously: Box 44 of the
       Single Administrative Document - SAD)
     * The nomenclature of country/territory codes used in the different
       Data Elements of the Customs Declaration, in accordance with
       Commission Regulation (EU) No 1106/2012 of 27 November 2012
       implementing Regulation (EC) No 471/2009 of the European Parliament
       and of the Council on Community statistics relating to external
       trade with non-member countries, as regards the update of the
       nomenclature of countries and territories.

   The TARIC does not contain information relating to national levies such
   as rates of VAT and rates of excises.

   TARIC raw data is also freely available in Excel format.
