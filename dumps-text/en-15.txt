    3. Excise duties

Excise duties on alcohol, tobacco and energy

   Excise duties are indirect taxes on the sale or use of specific
   products, such as alcohol, tobacco and energy. The revenue from these
   excise duties goes entirely to the country to which they are paid.

   EU countries agreed on common EU rules to make sure that excise duties
   are applied in the same way and to the same products everywhere in the
   Union.

   This helps prevent trade distortions in the Single Market, ensures fair
   competition between businesses, and reduces administrative burdens for
   companies.

   In addition, EU law sets out [79]common provisions, which apply to all
   products subject to excise duties. These common provisions include the
   framework for the [80]Excise Monitoring and Control System (EMCS), an
   IT system for monitoring the movement of excise goods within the EU.

   Legal texts

       arrangements for excise duty (recast)
     * [82]Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 on administrative
       cooperation in the field of excise duties as regards the content of
       electronic registers (subsequently amended by Council Regulations
       2020/263, 2021/774 and 2023/246)
     * [83]Decision (EU) 2020/263 on computerising the movement and
       surveillance of excise goods (recast)

   products by a business in one Member State to a business in another.
