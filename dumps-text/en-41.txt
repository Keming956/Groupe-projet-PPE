Prevent duty training: Learn how to support people susceptible to
radicalisation

   Prevent sits alongside long-established safeguarding duties on
   professionals to protect people from a range of other harms such as
   substance abuse, involvement in gangs and physical and sexual
   exploitation.

   Prevent is one part of the government's overall counter-terrorism
   strategy, CONTEST. The aim of Prevent is to:
     * tackle the ideological causes of terrorism
     * intervene early to support people susceptible to radicalisation
     * enable people who have already engaged in terrorism to disengage
       and rehabilitate

Who Prevent duty training is for

   This training is for people working in sectors covered by the Prevent
   duty, such as:
     * education
     * health
     * local authorities
     * police
     * criminal justice agencies (prisons, probation, youth justice)

   Other sectors that are not covered by the Prevent duty may also
   complete this training.

Prevent duty courses

   In these training courses, you will learn about:
     * the Prevent duty
     * different extremist ideologies that can lead to terrorism
     * the risk around radicalisation and your supportive role
     * making a Prevent referral that is both informed and made with good
       intention
     * the interventions and support available
