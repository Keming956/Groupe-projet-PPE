   The Origin Procedures in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (Articles
   37 to 67) set out the process for goods to prove their originating
   status and how a reduced rate of Customs Duty (known as a tariff
   preference) can be claimed.

Claiming preferential tariff treatment

   Read the relevant [46]Trade and Cooperation Agreement articles:
     * Claim for preferential tariff treatment (article 54 on page 71 —
       section 2 — Origin Procedures)
     * Time of the claim for preferential tariff treatment (article 55 on
       page 72 — section 2 — Origin Procedures)
     * Small consignments (article 60 on page 76 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Confidentiality (article 64 on page 86 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)

How to claim preference

   The customs authority receiving the goods will grant preferential
   tariff treatment. This will be based on a claim made by the importer,
   for goods that originate in the partner country and meet the conditions
   of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.

   Under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, a claim can be made if the
   importer has one of the following proofs of origin:
     * a statement on origin that the product is originating, made out by
       the exporter
     * importer’s knowledge that the product is originating

   A claim for preference, and the ‘presentation’ of the proof of origin,
   is normally included on the customs declaration to enter the goods into
   free circulation. However, a claim can also be made after importation
   as long as it is made within 3 years of the importation date and
   accompanied with a valid proof of origin. In those circumstances any
   duties would be repaid to the importer.

   You can claim preference for different goods on the same document.
   You’ll need to clearly identify the goods that are originating and
   non-originating. There is no fixed method for doing this — the only
   requirement is that those goods are clearly indicated.

   In the UK, a [47]claim for duties to be repaid is made using C285,
   however there are different ways to claim the preferential rate of duty
   depending on which system you’re using to make your import declaration.

If you’re using Customs Declaration Service software

   Data Element (DE) What you must include
   DE 2/3 Must include one of the following codes, as appropriate:
   • U110 — if the claim is based on a ‘statement on origin’ for a single
   shipment
   • U111 — if the claim is based on a ‘statement on origin’ for multiple
   shipments of identical products to cover a 12-month
   • U112 — if the claim is based on importers knowledge, using status
   code JP
   Codes U110 and U111 must be declared with one of the following status
   codes: AE, AF, AG, AP, AS, AT, GE, GP, HP, JE, JP, LE, LP, UA, UE, UP,
   US, XB.
   DE 4/17 Must include a preference code in the 300 series.
   DE 5/16 Must be completed with the country of preferential origin.

   For goods imported from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021, traders
   will have up to 175 days to complete customs declarations. This will
   give traders extra time to make arrangements to evidence their claim to
   the preferential tariff rate.

Rules for small consignments of goods

   As long as they are declared to the customs authorities as meeting the
   origin rules, some goods may be imported without the need for a formal
   proof of origin (a waiver).

   For import into the EU, this waiver applies to goods valued under
   either:
     * 500 euros for products sent in small packages
     * 1,200 euros for products forming part of a traveller’s personal
       luggage

   For the EU, this waiver does not apply to commercial imports.

   For import into the UK, this waiver applies to any goods valued in
   total under £1,000, if they are imported for commercial or
   non-commercial purposes. Where the total value of the all the goods is
   over £1,000, you can only claim preference on those goods for which you
   can prove the preferential origin.

   These waivers do not apply if it is established that the import forms a
   series of importations that are being made separately to avoid the
   normal requirements.

Applying for preference using a statement on origin

   Read the relevant [48]Trade and Cooperation Agreement articles:
     * Cumulation of origin (article 40 on page 56 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Statement on origin (article 56 on page 73 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Discrepancies (article 57 on page 74 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Record-keeping requirements (article 59 on page 75 — section 2 —
       Origin Procedures)
     * Denial of preferential tariff treatment (article 63 on page 83 —
       section 2 — Origin Procedures)

Statement on origin

   One option for claiming preference is for the importer to use a
   ‘statement on origin’ made out by the exporter. A statement on origin
   is prescribed text which the exporter adds to the invoice or any other
   document that describes the originating product in enough detail to
   allow it to be identified. The statement or document may be in an
   electronic format.

   Other products, which may be included on the document, should be
   clearly distinguished from the originating products.

   An exporter completing a statement on origin must hold information
   showing that the product is originating, including information on the
   originating status of materials used in the production of the product.
   This may include declarations obtained from their suppliers.

   A statement on origin may apply to either:
     * a single consignment
     * multiple shipments of identical products within any period
       specified in the statement on origin but not more than 12 months
       from the date of the first import

   If an exporter completes a statement on origin and later becomes aware
   that it holds incorrect information, they must let their customer know
   immediately in writing.

   A statement may be made in English or any of the other official
   languages used in the EU. However, it is best to use the same language
   used for the document.

   The following sections in this guide have more details of requirements
   about the document, suppliers’ declarations and the exporter.

   The text of the statement on origin is shown in Annex 7 of the
   [49]Trade and Cooperation Agreement.

   You must hold a supplier declaration (when needed) at the time you
   issue a statement on origin.

   If you do not have a supplier declaration, or other information to show
   the originating status of the goods, for any statements on origin
   you’ve issued during the easement period (1 January 2021 to 31 December
   2021), then there is an obligation on you to let your customer know.

   If you’re subject to a request for verification and you cannot provide
   evidence to show that the goods you exported to the EU originate in the
   UK, your EU customer will be liable to pay the full rate of Customs
   Duty.

Exporter requirements

   The exporter:
     * must be located in the UK to export to the EU
     * must be located in the EU to export to the UK
     * can be any person (such as a producer or a trading company) as long
       as they fulfil the obligations under the Trade and Cooperation
       Agreement, the exporter does not need to lodge the customs export
       declaration in respect of the products — they can [50]appoint a
       customs representative to act on their behalf
     * exports or produces the originating product, and makes out a
       statement on origin
     * is responsible for the correct identification of the originating
       products on the invoice or any other document, including a
       commercial document

   They will usually be identified on the statement on origin by their
   exporter reference number. If an exporter’s reference number has not
   been assigned, the exporter may show their full address under ‘place
   and date’.

   In the EU, the exporter’s reference number will be the exporter’s
   registered exporter (REX) number. These are needed if the exporter
   exports consignments with a total value of more than 6,000 euros.

   In the UK, the exporter’s reference number will be the EORI number. If
   you do not have one, you can [51]apply for an EORI number.

   The statement on origin must be made out by the exporter. It does not
   need to give any details of the person issuing the document used for
   completing the statement. To avoid confusion, it is recommended that
   the exporter makes out the statement on origin on a document they have
   issued.

Validity of the statement on origin

   A statement on origin may be made out before, at the same time as, or
   after the products that it relates to are exported. For imports to the
   UK it will be valid for 2 years from the date it was made out. For
   exports to the EU it will be valid for 12 months.

   The statement on origin must be valid when the claim for preferential
   tariff treatment is made. This might be either the time when:
     * the import declaration in respect of the originating products is
       accepted by the customs authorities
     * an application for repayment or remission of customs duties is
       submitted

Supplier declarations

   Information in this section applies to supplier declarations that a UK
   supplier gives to either a UK producer or UK exporter. Goods and
   materials that originate under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and
   are imported from, or exported to, EU suppliers, must show their
   originating status through either a statement on origin or importer’s
   knowledge.

   For supplies of non-originating goods and materials, where some
   domestic production has been applied in the UK or EU, that production
   can be counted towards bilateral cumulation if the goods or materials
   are supported by the supplier declaration for non-originating goods as
   set out in:
     * Article 40 of the [52]Trade and Cooperation Agreement
     * Annex 6 (supplier declaration) of the [53]Trade and Cooperation
       Agreement

   A supplier uses a supplier declaration to give information to a
   producer or exporter about the originating status of goods, on the
   specific preferential rules of origin. The supplier is the person who
   has control and the knowledge of the originating status over the
   delivered goods.

   By completing a supplier declaration the supplier declares the
   originating status of the goods they provide to their customer. The
   customer needs this information to make out a statement on origin (the
   exported goods are either the finished product from the supplier or a
   product incorporating the delivered material).

When supplier declarations are needed

   There are occasions where manufacture on its own is not enough to meet
   the origin rules, and suppliers’ declarations are needed. For example,
   if:
     * any materials do not change tariff heading
     * the value of materials is over the specified limit, for example the
       origin rule may specify a percentage limit of 40% for
       non-originating materials, and the total value of materials used is
       45% of the ex-works price — you will then need declarations to
       cover the value of materials in excess of the limit, that is, 5% of
       the ex-works price
     * you manufacture using materials at a later stage of production than
       that specified, for example using bought-in fabric where the origin
       rule is manufacture from yarn
     * the only processing which you carry out on a product is among the
       minimal processes listed in Article 43 (page 61) of the [54]Trade
       and Cooperation Agreement
     * you buy and export goods in the same state

When supplier declarations are not needed

   If you are a manufacturer either exporting or supplying your goods,
   there are certain circumstances where a declaration will not be needed:
     * an origin rule may specify that all non-originating materials must
       change tariff heading (if, during manufacture, all materials change
       tariff heading then the rule is met without the need for any
       suppliers’ declarations)
     * a percentage rule may specify a limit on the value of
       non-originating materials (30% or 40%), if the total value of all
       materials is within this limit, then the rule will be met
     * an origin rule may specify manufacture from materials at a certain
       stage of production, for example manufacture from yarn, if you
       manufacture using materials at or before the specified stage (for
       example yarn or pre yarn) then the rule will be met automatically

   A supplier declaration can be made out to cover a single supply or to
   cover regular supplies made over a period of time (a long-term supplier
   declaration).

   Long-term supplier declarations are one-off declarations valid for
   supplies delivered during a period up to a maximum of 2 years.

   A long-term supplier declaration is valid for all the goods mentioned
   in the supplier declaration that are delivered within the specified
   period. When completing a long-term supplier declaration, the
   originating status of the goods must be confirmed for the whole period
   that it is valid for.

   The supplier should tell the customer of the goods immediately, if the
   information given in their long-term supplier declaration is no longer
   applicable.

   A long-term supplier declaration should be made out for consignments
   dispatched during a period of time and should give the date:
     * when the declaration is made out (date of issue)
     * of commencement of the period (start date) — which may not be more
       than 12 months before, or more than 6 months after the date of
       issue
     * of the end of the period (end date) — which may not be more than 24
       months after the start date

   Find more [55]information on supplier declarations.

Bilateral cumulation and supplier declarations

   An exporter completing a statement on origin for a product that has
   benefitted from bilateral cumulation may also need to provide a
   supplier declaration.

   For example, where a product has obtained its originating status
   through cumulating production carried out in the EU on non-originating
   materials, the exporter of those goods must get a declaration from the
   supplier of those materials.

   If you’re exporting goods to the EU for bilateral cumulation, you must
   issue a supplier declaration when each of the following applies to the
   goods:
     * they do not originate in the UK
     * they have had some UK processing carried out on them
     * they will be used by your EU customer to produce another product
       that does not meet the rules of origin for import to the UK

   If you’re importing goods from the EU for bilateral cumulation, you
   must get a supplier declaration from your EU supplier when each of the
   following applies to the goods:
     * they do not originate in the EU
     * they have had some EU processing carried out on them
     * you will use them to produce another product in the UK that meets
       the rules of origin for export to the EU

   This declaration could either be in the form set out in Annex 6
   (supplier declaration) of the [56]Trade and Cooperation Agreement or an
   equivalent document that has the same information, describing the
   non-originating materials concerned in enough detail so they can be
   identified. As with supplier declarations in the context of intra-UK
   supply chains, a supplier declaration to cover production carried out
   in the EU may be made out to cover either a single supply or regular
   supplies made over a period of time.

   Where the exported product has obtained its originating status through
   the cumulation of originating materials, the exporter must hold a
   statement on origin from the supplier based in the EU.

Record keeping requirements for a statement on origin

   An importer making a claim for preferential tariff treatment must keep
   the statement on origin made out by the exporter for 4 years from the
   date of importation.

   An exporter who has made out a statement on origin must keep, for 4
   years from the date it was made out, a copy of the statement on origin
   and all other records showing that the product satisfies the
   requirements to get originating status (for example, suppliers’
   declarations and invoices).

   In both cases, these records can be stored in an electronic format.

Multiple shipments

   A statement on origin can be made to cover multiple shipments of
   identical products supplied to a customer under the same contract over
   a 12-month period, instead of separate statements for each individual
   consignment.

   A statement on origin for multiple shipments should give the date:
     * when it is made out (date of issue)
     * of commencement of the period (start date)
     * of the end of the period (end date) — which may not be more than 12
       months after the date it was made out

   A statement on origin for multiple shipments of identical products may
   be used as a basis for claims to preferential tariff treatment accepted
   from the date of issue and covering declarations made on or between the
   start date and the end date indicated in the statement.

   The importer should keep the documents for the later consignments
   imported within the validity period for which preferential tariff
   treatment is claimed, on the basis the statement on origin for multiple
   shipments.

   The documents for later consignments do not need to have a statement on
   origin.

   A statement on origin for multiple shipments must be withdrawn by the
   exporter if the conditions for its use are no longer fulfilled. The
   withdrawal must be documented in connection with the original statement
   on origin for multiple shipments. Once the withdrawal is documented, a
   new statement on origin must be completed if the delivered products are
   again originating products.

Applying for preference using importer’s knowledge

   Read the relevant [57]Trade and Cooperation Agreement articles:
     * Cumulation of origin (article 40 on page 56 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Importer’s knowledge (article 58 on page 74 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Discrepancies (article 57 on page 74 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Record-keeping requirements (article 59 on page 75 — section 2 —
       Origin Procedures)
     * Denial of preferential Tariff treatment (article 63 on page 83 —
       section 2 — Origin Procedures)

   ‘Importer’s knowledge’ is an option that allows the importer to claim
   preferential tariff treatment based on their own knowledge about the
   originating status of imported products. It can be used as an
   alternative to a statement on origin provided by the exporter.

   As the importer is making a claim using their own knowledge, the
   exporter or producer does not need to do anything to officially state
   the originating status of the goods.

   As this option requires the importer to have knowledge that the
   products meet the relevant rules of origin, the exporter or producer
   may have to provide information about the production to the importer.
   This may be in addition to other information (such as supporting
   documents or records) which the importer may already have.

   The information could include:
     * the Harmonised System (HS) code of the product and origin criteria
       used
     * a brief description of the production process
     * if the origin criterion was based on a specific production process,
       a specific description of that process
     * if applicable, a description of the originating and non-originating
       materials used in the production process
     * if the origin criterion was ‘wholly obtained’, the applicable
       category (such as harvesting, mining, or fishing and the place of
       production)
     * if the origin criterion was based on a value method, the value of
       the product as well as the value of either all the non-originating
       or originating, or both, materials used in the production
     * if the origin criterion was based on weight, the weight of the
       product as well as the weight of either the relevant
       non-originating or originating, or both, materials used in the
       product
     * if the origin criterion was based on a change in the commodity code
       used to classify goods, a list of all the non-originating materials
       including their commodity code under the Harmonised System (in 2, 4
       or 6-digit format depending on the origin criteria)
     * the information relating to the compliance with the provision on
       non-alteration (if applicable), for example a certificate of
       non-manipulation from the Customs Authority in the country of
       transit

   If the importer cannot get the information, including when the exporter
   or producer does not provide the information because it is deemed
   commercially sensitive, preferential tariff treatment may still be
   claimed if the exporter issues a statement on origin.

   An importer making a claim for preferential tariff treatment must keep
   all records that show that the product is eligible for preference for 4
   years from the date of importation. These records may be stored in an
   electronic format.

Verification of claims for preferential treatment

   Read the relevant [58]Trade and Cooperation Agreement articles:
     * Verification (article 61 on page 78 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Administrative cooperation (article 62 on page 80 — section 2 —
       Origin Procedures)

   To verify if a product imported under preference is originating, the
   importing customs authority may carry out a verification. This may
   include a request for information from the importer who made the claim
   for preferential tariff treatment.

   Verification may be carried out before or after the release of the
   goods.

   If carrying out a verification before release of the goods, the customs
   authority may suspend the granting of preferential tariff treatment
   pending the results. When this happens release of the products should
   be offered to the importer, subject to a security or guarantee to cover
   the difference between the preferential and full tariff.

Claims based on a statement on origin by the exporter

   For claims based on a statement on origin made out by the exporter in
   the exporting party, verification is given in the following 2 steps.

Step 1

   The importing party’s customs authority requests the statement on
   origin from the importer. If the importer has any additional
   information supporting the fulfilment of origin criteria it can be
   provided.

   Outside of any contractual obligations between the importer and the
   exporter, there is no obligation for the exporter to provide any
   further information to the importer.

   However, if an exporter receives a request from the importer and
   prefers to give information at this stage of the verification process,
   they can do so, either to the importer or to the importing party’s
   customs authority directly.

   By giving information following the request during step 1 of the
   verification process, the exporter may avoid being asked for the
   information by their own customs authority following a request for
   administrative cooperation as part of step 2.

Step 2

   Where the importing customs authority needs to further verify the
   statement on origin or the originating status of the goods, they may
   request administrative cooperation from the customs authority in the
   exporting party.

   The exporting party’s customs authority must carry out checks on the
   exporter’s records and processes. This may involve visiting the
   exporter and confirming the goods’ eligibility to preferential tariff
   treatment in a written report back to the importing customs authority
   within 10 months of the request.

   A request for administrative cooperation is only possible when the
   claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a statement on
   origin.

Claims based on importer’s knowledge

   For claims based on importer’s knowledge, verification is given in the
   following 2 steps.

Step 1

   The importing party’s customs authority requests from the importer no
   more information than that supporting fulfilment of origin criteria,
   which is:
     * ‘wholly obtained’ — the applicable category (such as harvesting,
       mining, fishing) and place of production
     * based on change in commodity code used to classify goods — a list
       of all the non-originating materials including their commodity code
       (in 2, 4 or 6-digit format, depending on the origin criterion in
       the list rules)
     * based on a value method — the value of the final product as well as
       the value of all the non-originating materials used in the
       production
     * based on weight — the weight of the final product as well as the
       weight of the relevant non-originating materials used in the final
       product
     * based on a specific production process — a description of that
       specific process

   The importer must respond within 3 months and may add any other
   information that they consider relevant for verification.

Step 2

   Where the importing party’s customs authority needs more information to
   determine the originating status of the product and following step 1,
   they may ask the importer to give more information.

   The importing party’s customs authority cannot request administrative
   cooperation from the exporting party’s customs authority, as no
   statement on origin has been raised by the exporter. Therefore, the
   importer must be able to show that the product is originating and
   qualifies for preferential tariff treatment.

   This does not necessarily mean that all information should be easily
   available in the records of the importer at the time the claim for
   preferential tariff treatment is made, but the importer must be able to
   supply the necessary information within the time period (3 months under
   this agreement) of the request for additional information.

Denial of preferential tariff treatment

   Under specific circumstances, a claim for preferential tariff treatment
   may be denied by either party’s custom’s authority.

   A claim for preferential tariff treatment may be denied:
     * if the importer does not provide information when requested
     * where a request for verification is sent to the exporting customs
       authority and a reply is not received within 10 months
     * the verification report does not contain enough information to
       determine origin

   As long as it does not cause doubt as to the origin of the goods, a
   claim for preferential tariff treatment will not be rejected:
     * due to minor errors or discrepancies in the statement on origin
     * for the sole reason that an invoice was issued in a non-party
       country

The text of the statement on origin (Annex 7 of the Trade and Cooperation
Agreement)

   (Period: from ………………… to ………………… [59][footnote 1])

   The exporter of the products covered by this document (Exporter
   Reference Number … [60][footnote 2]) declares that, except where
   otherwise clearly indicated, these products are of … [61][footnote 3]
   preferential origin.

   …………………………………………………………… [62][footnote 4]
   (Place and date)

   ……………………………………………………………
   (Name of the exporter)

Footnotes

    1. If the statement on origin is completed for multiple shipments of
       identical originating products within the meaning of point (b) of
       Article 56 — statement on origin of the [63]Trade and Cooperation
       Agreement of this Agreement, indicate the period for which the
       statement on origin is to apply. That period shall not exceed 12
       months. All importations of the product must occur within the
       period indicated. If a period is not applicable, the field may be
       left blank.
    2. Indicate the reference number by which the exporter is identified.
       For the Union exporter, this will be the number assigned in
       accordance with the laws and regulations of the Union. For the
       United Kingdom exporter, this will be the number assigned in
       accordance with the laws and regulations applicable within the
       United Kingdom. Where the exporter has not been assigned a number,
       this field may be left blank.
    3. Indicate the origin of the product: the United Kingdom or the
       Union.
    4. Place and date may be omitted if the information is contained on
       the document itself.
