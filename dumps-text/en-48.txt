What Is a Fiduciary Duty?

   Fiduciary duty refers to the relationship between a fiduciary and the
   principal or beneficiary on whose behalf the fiduciary acts.

   The fiduciary accepts legal responsibility for duties of care, loyalty,
   good faith, confidentiality, and more when serving the best interests
   of a beneficiary. Strict care must be taken to ensure that no conflict
   of interest arises to jeopardize those interests.

Key Takeaways

     * A fiduciary duty involves actions taken in the best interests of
       another person or entity.
     * Fiduciary duty describes the relationship between an attorney and a
       client or a guardian and a ward.
     * Fiduciary duties include duty of care, loyalty, good faith,
       confidentiality, prudence, and disclosure.
     * It has been successfully argued that an employee may have a
       fiduciary duty of loyalty to an employer.
     * A breach of fiduciary duty occurs when a fiduciary fails to act
       responsibly in the best interests of a client.

Examples of Fiduciary Relationships

Trustee/Beneficiary

   A single parent with young children might create a trust to administer
   the assets that the children would inherit should the parent die while
   the children are still underage.

   In this case, the parent will name a person or an entity, such as a law
   firm or bank, as trustee of the estate. That person or entity has a
   fiduciary duty to the children, who are the beneficiaries of the
   estate.

   In a trustee/beneficiary relationship, the fiduciary (trustee) has
   legal ownership of the property and controls the assets held in the
   trust.

   As fiduciary, the trustee must make decisions that are in the best
   interest of the beneficiary as the latter holds equitable title to
   the property.

   The trustee/beneficiary relationship is an important aspect of
   comprehensive estate planning. Special care should be taken to
   determine who is designated as trustee.

Guardian/Ward

   In a guardian/ward relationship, an adult is designated as the legal
   guardian of a minor child. The guardian, as the fiduciary, is tasked
   with ensuring that all matters related to the daily welfare of the
   child are dealt with responsibly and in the best interests of the
   child. This care can include such things as deciding where the child
   will attend school, arranging for health care, and providing an
   allowance.

   A guardian may be appointed by a state court when a parent dies or is
   unable to care for the child for other reasons. In most states, the
   guardian/ward relationship remains intact until the minor child reaches
   adulthood.

Agent/Principal

   Any person, corporation, partnership, or government agency might be
   called upon to act as agent without conflict of interest on behalf of a
   principal.

   A common example of an agent/principal relationship that implies
   fiduciary duty is that between the executives of a company and its
   shareholders. The shareholders expect that the executives will make
   well-considered, prudent decisions on their behalf and in their best
   interests as owners.

   A similar fiduciary relationship exists between personal investors and
   the fund managers they select to manage their assets.

Attorney/Client

   The agreement between an attorney and a client is arguably one of the
   most stringent of fiduciary relationships.

   The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that the highest level of trust and
   confidence must exist between an attorney and a client. An attorney, as
   a fiduciary, must act with fairness, loyalty, care, and within the law
   on behalf of the client.

   Attorneys can be sued for breaches of their fiduciary duties by
   clients. They are accountable to the court in which a client is
   represented when a breach occurs.

Controlling Stockholder/Company

   In certain circumstances, fiduciary duties may be required of a
   stockholder who possesses a majority interest in a corporation or who
   exercises control over its activities. A breach of fiduciary duty may
   result in personal legal liability for the controlling shareholder as
   well as directors and officers.

   The adjective fiduciary means held or given in trust. A fiduciary
   commits to acting in the best interests of a principal or beneficiary.

Types of Fiduciary Duties

   Fiduciary duties may differ depending on the type of beneficiary that a
   fiduciary serves. However, in general, the legal and ethical
   obligations related to protecting the interests of beneficiaries
   include the following duties.

Duty of Care

   This is the responsibility to inform oneself as completely as possible
   in order to exercise sound judgments that protect a beneficiary's
   interests. It can involve the thoughtful consideration of options and
   sensible decision-making that's based on a careful examination of
   available information.

Duty of Loyalty

   This pertains to acting in the best interest of the beneficiary at all
   times, putting their well-being first and foremost. It includes the
   duty of the fiduciary to excuse themself from taking actions when
   there's a conflict of interest with the beneficiary's welfare.

Duty of Good Faith

   This duty pertains to always acting within the law to advance the
   interests of the beneficiary. At no time should the fiduciary take
   actions that are outside of legal constraints.

Duty of Confidentiality

   A fiduciary must maintain the confidentiality of all information
   relating to the beneficiary. They must not use any form of it, whether
   written or spoken, for their personal gain.

Duty of Prudence

   Fiduciaries must administer matters and make decisions concerning the
   interests of beneficiaries with the highest degree of professional
   skill, caution, and critical awareness of risk.

Duty to Disclose

   Fiduciaries must engage in completely forthright behavior, disclosing
   any and all relevant information that could have an impact on their
   ability to carry out their duties as fiduciary and/or on the well-being
   of a beneficiary's interests.

Breaches in Fiduciary Duty

   Fiduciary duties are taken on by individuals and entities for various
   types of beneficiaries. Such relationships include, among others,
   lawyers acting for clients, company executives acting for stockholders,
   guardians acting for their wards, financial advisers acting for
   investors, and trustees acting for estate beneficiaries.

   An employee may even have a fiduciary duty to an employer. That is,
   employers have a right to expect that employees are acting in their
   best interests. For example, they are not sharing trade secrets, or
   using company equipment for private purposes, or stealing customers
   from a competitor.

   These expectations may not be actual fiduciary duties but they may be
   spelled out in an employee handbook or contract clause.

   Case law indicates that breaches of fiduciary duty most often happen
   when a binding fiduciary relationship is in effect and actions are
   taken which violate or are counterproductive to the interests of a
   specific beneficiary.

   Typically, the inappropriate actions are alleged to have benefitted the
   fiduciary's interests or the interests of a third party instead of a
   principal's or beneficiary's interests. In some cases, a breach stems
   from a fiduciary's failure to provide important information to a
   client, which leads to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, or
   misguided advice.

   Disclosure of any potential conflict of interest is important in a
   fiduciary relationship because any conflict can be seen as a cause for
   a breach of trust.

Consequences of a Fiduciary Breach

   A breach of fiduciary duty can lead to a number of consequences. Not
   all of them are legal consequences.
    1. An accusation of a breach of fiduciary duty can hurt the reputation
       of a professional. A client can end a professional relationship
       because they do not trust in a professional’s care of the required
       fiduciary duty.
    2. If a breach of duty case proceeds to the courts, steeper
       consequences can result. A successful breach of fiduciary duty
       lawsuit can result in monetary penalties for direct damages,
       indirect damages, and legal costs.
    3. A court ruling can also lead to industry discrediting, the loss of
       a license, or removal from service.

   However, proving a breach of fiduciary duty is not always easy.

Elements of a Fiduciary Breach Claim

   A number of legal precedents and elements have been established to
   allow claims by those who have been harmed by a breach of fiduciary
   duty. Jurisdictions differ, but in general, the following four elements
   are essential if a plaintiff is to prevail in a breach of fiduciary
   duty claim.

A Duty Existed

   The plaintiff must show that a legal fiduciary duty existed. Many
   professionals are obligated, legally and ethically, to conduct their
   businesses honestly. However, that doesn't mean that they are
   fiduciaries who must act solely in the interest of a particular client.
   A fiduciary duty is accepted as such by a fiduciary, typically in
   writing.

A Breach Occurred

   The plaintiff must show that a fiduciary duty was breached. The type of
   breach varies in every case. For example, if an accountant was sloppy
   in filling out a client's tax returns, and the client was slapped with
   an enormous fine for nonpayment, the accountant may be guilty of a
   breach of fiduciary duty. However, if the client was sloppy and failed
   to provide complete and necessary information, no breach occurred.

Damage Was Sustained

   The plaintiff must show that the breach of trust caused actual damage.
   Without damage, there is usually no basis for a breach of fiduciary
   duty case. The more specific a principal or beneficiary can be with
   facts of damage, the better.

   For example, a trustee might be sued for selling a beneficiary's
   property too cheaply. If the buyer is a relative of the trustee, it's
   clearly a conflict of interest. However, a specific accounting relating
   to the loss to the beneficiary is needed to prove a breach of fiduciary
   duty.

Causation Was Proved

   Causation shows that any damages incurred by the plaintiff were
   directly linked with the actions taken in breach of fiduciary duty. In
   the above example of a property sale, the link appears to be clear.
   However, the trustee might argue that a quick sale was in the best
   interest of the beneficiary and that no other buyer was interested.

   If you suspect your financial adviser is in breach of their fiduciary
   duty, you can file a complaint with FINRA, the SEC, or both. If your
   adviser has a professional certification, you can also notify the
   entity that provided the credential.

Examples of Fiduciary Breach Cases

A Duty of Loyalty

   One example of a breach in fiduciary duty case went to the Virginia
   Supreme Court in 2007.

   In "Banks v. Mario Industries of Virginia, Inc." a lighting
   manufacturer and supplier sued a former employee for establishing a
   directly competing business by allegedly using proprietary information
   acquired in their previous employment.

   The manufacturer did not require its employees to sign a non-compete or
   confidentiality clause, although the company handbook outlined related
   policies.

   In this case, the question of whether the employees had a fiduciary
   duty to their former employer, and breached it, was fundamental to the
   appeal that brought the case to the state's highest court.

   The court affirmed the lower court's ruling that the employees owed
   Mario a duty of loyalty. In effect, it supported the claim of a breach
   of fiduciary duty, and a penalty of more than $1 million.

A Menswear Store vs. Ex-Employees

   In 2006, a high-end menswear store cited a breach of fiduciary duty
   when it sued two of its former sales professionals for taking a job
   with a competitor, Saks Fifth Avenue. The department store was able to
   prove that it suffered actual losses after the salesmen left.

   However, the court ruled that the losses could not be attributed
   directly to the actions of its former employees. The suit failed.

Aiding and Abetting a Breach of Duty

   A comptroller for a corporation embezzled $15 million from his employer
   by writing checks against his company's bank account and depositing
   them into another account at his own bank.

   The company sued the bank that took the deposits, alleging that it
   aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty. The court ruled that
   there was insufficient evidence that the bank was aware of its role in
   the scam.

What Does It Mean to Have a Fiduciary Duty?

   The adjective fiduciary means held or given in trust. In accepting a
   fiduciary duty, an individual or entity accepts a legal commitment to
   act in the best interests of a beneficiary.

What Are the Main Fiduciary Duties?

   There are several types of fiduciary duties. One is the duty of loyalty
   which implies that the fiduciary will always act in the best interests
   of the beneficiary or principal. Duty of care is another. It means that
   a fiduciary will take special care to make sound, sensible decisions
   regarding a beneficiary's well-being. No conflicting interest will be
   permitted to influence the fiduciary's actions on behalf of the client.
   Duty to disclose is a third. It refers to the duty a fiduciary has to
   disclose any conflict of interest they may have when acting on behalf
   of a beneficiary.

What Are Some Examples of Fiduciary Relationships?

   The most common fiduciary relationships involve legal or financial
   professionals who agree to act on behalf of their clients. For example,
   a lawyer and a client have a fiduciary relationship. So do a trustee
   and a beneficiary, a corporate board and its shareholders, and an agent
   acting for a principal.

   However, any individual may, in some cases, have a fiduciary duty to
   another person or entity. For example, an employee may be found to have
   a duty of loyalty to an employer and may be legally liable if they
   cause harm to the employer by misusing information or resources
   entrusted to them.

What Does It Mean to Be a Fiduciary?

   A fiduciary is entrusted with the authority to act on behalf of another
   person or entity and has the legal and ethical obligation to act in the
   best interest of them. A fiduciary agrees to put a beneficiary's
   interest above their own.

The Bottom Line

   Fiduciary duties refer to the ways that a fiduciary is legally
   committed to act for a principal or beneficiary. They include a duty of
   loyalty, a duty of care, a duty of prudence, a duty of confidentiality,
   and more.

   Fiduciary duties are meant to ensure that the fiduciary acts only in
   the best interests of a principal or beneficiary. What's more, the
   fiduciary must act diligently to protect those interests.

   While you should always expect a high standard of care from a
   fiduciary, you can protect yourself by understanding the rights that
   this relationship grants you and the responsibilities that are not part
   of a fiduciary's duties.
