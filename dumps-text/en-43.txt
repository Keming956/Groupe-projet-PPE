Consumer Duty – information for firms

   First published: 03/10/2022 Last updated: 01/11/2023 See all updates

   To help firms implement the Duty, we explain more on the areas of the
   Duty that we have been receiving firm queries on which are relevant for
   the wider market.

   We will keep this updated.

   Our approach to supervision and enforcement

   When the Duty comes into force firms need to make sure, and be able to
   show us, that they are acting to deliver good customer outcomes.

   We will be proportionate to the harm – or risk of harm - to consumers,
   prioritising the most serious breaches and acting swiftly and
   assertively. In some cases, firms can expect us to take robust action,
   such as interventions or investigations, along with possible
   disciplinary sanctions.

   We understand that some firms will need to continually improve the way
   they use data and analytics to demonstrate compliance and we will be
   pragmatic and open in working with them on this.

   Our expectations for outcomes monitoring

   A key part of the Duty is that firms assess, test, understand and
   evidence the outcomes their customers are receiving. Without this, it
   will be impossible for firms to know that they are meeting the
   requirements set out in the Consumer Duty.

   The type of information firms will use will vary depending on factors
   like:
     * size
     * client base
     * types of products and services that they offer

   Firms will need to use their judgement to identify data sources as
   evidence against the outcomes of the Duty. Chapter 11 of our Finalised
   Guidance gives examples of the types of data firms could collect.

    Monitoring outcomes is only required after the implementation
   deadline. But we recommend that firms start monitoring sooner to check
   they’re ready in time.

   During the implementation period we will monitor firms’ readiness and
   feed back insights to the market.

   Consumer Duty Board champions

   We want firms’ Boards and senior management to make good outcomes for
   consumers central to their firm’s culture, strategy and business
   objectives.

   In FG22/5, we said that we expect firms to have a champion at Board (or
   equivalent governing body) level. We said that this champion should be
   an Independent Non-Executive Director (NED), where possible. For larger
   organisations with group structures, we expect this champion to be at
   an appropriate Board level so that the Duty is discussed in a
   meaningful way.

   The primary role of the Board champion is to support the Chair and CEO
   in raising the Duty regularly in all relevant discussions, and
   challenging the firm’s governing body/management on how it is embedding
   the Duty and focusing on consumer outcomes.

   This is not a ‘prescribed responsibility’ under the Senior Managers &
   Certification Regime (SM&CR). Firms can set it up in a way that fits
   with existing roles and responsibilities on their Boards.

   Generally, the Board champion should work with the Chair, but this will
   depend on the firm and its Board. In some cases, it may work for the
   Chair to be the Board champion for the Duty. Firms should apply their
   judgement and set up the role in a way that works for their
   organisation.

   This does not affect the Board’s collective responsibility under the
   Duty or their roles in complying with the Duty under existing
   governance procedures.

   In FG22/5, we have included examples of the types of questions the
   Board champion, or other members of firms’ governing bodies, could ask
   to make sure the firm is meeting expectations under the Duty. These
   questions illustrate the outcome focus of the Duty and are the sorts of
   questions we will ask firms.

   Definition of closed products

   The Duty comes into effect on:
     * 31 July 2023 - for new and existing products or services that are
       open for sale or renewal
     * 31 July 2024 - for closed products or services

   ‘Closed products’ are no longer marketed or distributed to retail
   customers nor open to renewal.

   If existing customers can continue to make payments under the existing
   product terms, this would still be considered ‘closed’ if the product
   or service is not open to new customers. For example, a pension product
   that is no longer sold to new customers, but where existing
   policyholders can continue to pay in contributions, would be considered
   closed.

   It is up to firms to consider each product and determine whether it is
   closed.

   Retrospective application

   The Consumer Duty does not apply retrospectively. Both we and the
   Financial Ombudsman Service work on the basis that conduct should be
   judged on the rules and standards in place at that time.

   We have been working closely with the Financial Ombudsman to make sure
   our interpretations are consistent, while recognising the different
   roles that we both play.

   Proportionality

   The Duty applies in a reasonable way. The focus on good customer
   outcomes applies to all aspects of firms’ operations and culture. All
   firms have a Duty to act to deliver good outcomes for their customers.
   What this means in practice will depend on key factors, including:
     * The nature of the product or service. More complicated products are
       likely to need more attention than simpler or less risky products.
     * The characteristics of a firm’s customers. Where customers are more
       likely to have characteristics of vulnerability, for example, we
       would expect it to take additional care.
     * The firm’s relationship with its customers. Obligations under the
       Duty reflect the firm’s role and ability to influence retail
       customer outcomes. We would expect firms to focus on harms that are
       reasonably foreseeable.
     * The size of the firm. We do not expect a small firm to apply the
       same resources or processes as a large firm.

   We set out more on how the Duty applies reasonably in Chapter 4 of
   FG22/5.

   Requirements for firms seeking authorisation

   If your firm is in scope of the Consumer Duty, your application must
   prove that you can comply with the Consumer Duty. We expect your
   application to be tailored to your firm and expressly set out how your
   firm will act to consistently deliver good outcomes to retail
   customers.

   To help us assess whether you can comply with the Consumer Duty you
   should provide all the policies, processes, Management Information (MI)
   and any other materials you have created or rely on to support your
   firm’s compliance with the Consumer Duty. These should include the
   following. This is not an exhaustive list and you may be asked to
   review and amend any documents you submit or create new documents
   should they deemed to be missing:
     * target market analysis and identification
     * a product and service governance framework
     * a fair value assessment framework
     * customer understanding assessment & testing framework
     * customer support monitoring polices and supporting Management
       Information (MI) suite
     * customer outcome monitoring framework
     * root cause identification process

   How the Duty applies to firms throughout the distribution chain

   The Duty applies to all firms with a key role in delivering retail
   customer outcomes, including those with no direct customer
   relationship. For example, it applies to firms that can determine or
   influence:
     * the design or operation of retail products or services, including
       their price and value
     * communications with retail customers
     * customer support for retail customers

   Where this applies, a firm’s responsibilities under the Duty will
   depend on the firm’s role and level of influence.

   See Chapter 2 of our Finalised Guidance for how the Duty applies across
   the distribution chain.

   Information-sharing in the distribution chain

   Manufacturers and distributors need to work together and share
   information, in order to perform their own roles effectively and
   deliver good outcomes.

   Distributors should have a clear understanding of the target market and
   the way products operate. We expect distributors to get the information
   they need from manufacturers, and manufacturers to be monitoring that
   their products are delivering good consumer outcomes.

   6.68 of FG22/5 includes examples of the type of information we would
   expect to be shared, where appropriate.

   In general, we do not expect distributors to share information without
   being asked. We expect the manufacturer to consider what information
   would be helpful and to take reasonable steps to gather it. For
   example, through focus groups or sending surveys to distributors.

   Unless there are regulatory or contractual requirements, firms are only
   responsible for their own activities and do not need to oversee the
   actions of other firms in the distribution chain.

   If a firm identifies consumer harm elsewhere in the chain it must raise
   the concerns with other relevant parties. This could include situations
   where a distributor identifies foreseeable harm or problems with the
   way a product or service is operating in practice.

   Firms must also notify us where they become aware that another firm in
   the distribution chain may not be complying with the Duty. This
   expectation is in line with the existing Principle 11 requirement to
   inform us of anything relating to the firm which we reasonably expect
   notice of.

   Application to non-UK firms

   Only firms conducting regulated activities in the UK are within our
   regulatory remit and subject to the Duty.

   Where the distribution chain involves firms in Gibraltar selling
   products or services to UK retail customers, the Duty still applies. It
   applies to those firms whether they have an establishment in the UK or
   operate on a cross-border basis.

   We recognise that risks remain for UK retail customers if the
   distribution chain involves other parties outside the UK that are not
   subject to equivalent requirements. To help manage this risk, UK
   distributors of non-UK products and services must take all reasonable
   steps to understand the product or service, the target market it would
   serve and the value it provides so that it will be distributed
   appropriately.

   Regulated firms should also consider whether including a firm that is
   not subject to the Duty in the distribution chain leads to a risk of
   poor customer outcomes.

   There is more information on application outside of the UK in Chapter 2
   of our FG22/5.

   Application to non-UK customers

   For firms dealing with non-UK customers, the Duty applies in line with
   the existing regulatory perimeter. Where current rules apply to a UK
   firm dealing with non-UK customers, the Duty will also apply.

   Where the chain includes firms outside the UK, which are not subject to
   the Duty, we recognise that UK firms may not be able to meet elements
   of the Duty to the same degree. A UK product manufacturer may find it
   difficult to obtain information from non-UK distributors about their
   distribution of the product.

   In this case, UK firms should consider what is reasonable in the
   circumstances. For example, they could use any information that they do
   have available to support their work. We would not expect UK firms to
   obtain information from firms that are not subject to the Duty.

   Clarifying the scope

   We have made some changes in the March 2023 Handbook Notice to make
   certain points clearer in the rules:
     * The application to firms approving or communicating financial
       promotions
     * The application to firms in the temporary marketing permissions
       regime (TMPR)
     * The ‘closed product’ and ‘existing product’ definitions
     * The application to credit unions

   This follows on from our consultation in December 2022 and the changes
   are consistent with our position in Consultation Paper CP21/36.

   We are still considering responses to the December consultation in
   relation to the amendments we had proposed on:
     * Defined benefit occupational pension schemes
     * Non-retail financial instruments
     * Exemptions in sectoral Sourcebooks

   If we take any of these proposals forward, we will grant an appropriate
   implementation period for any changes we make to the rules.

   Data protection law and customer communications

   Under the Consumer Understanding outcome, we expect consumers to be
   given the information they need, at the right time, and presented in a
   way they can understand.

   Data protection laws (the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018) and the
   Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR) don't
   stop firms from telling customers about better deals or providing
   information that they need to know as part of their relationship with
   that firm.

   Administrative or customer service messages aren't considered to be
   direct marketing, so there are no restrictions on communicating this
   type of information. Firms can also provide regulatory communications
   to all customers that provide neutral, factual information. For
   example, information about the product they hold, terms of other
   available products, and what their options are for moving to another
   product.

   The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) guidance on direct
   marketing and regulatory communications explains how to draft
   regulatory communications, and includes illustrative examples.
