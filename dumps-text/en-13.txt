Overview

   Conveyance duty, commonly known as stamp duty, is a tax you pay when
   you buy property in the ACT, whether it’s a home, land, or a commercial
   property.

   The Government is continuing to reduce conveyance duty rates for
   residential properties.

   Since 1 July 2021, eligible owner-occupiers of residential properties
   have paid a reduced rate of conveyance duty. On or after 1 July 2023,
   duty on owner-occupier purchases up to $260,000 will be at the lower
   rate of 0.49%.

   From 1 July 2023, commercial properties with a dutiable value of
   $1,800,000 or less will pay no conveyance duty. Where the value is
   greater than $1,800,000 a flat rate of 5 per cent will apply.

Calculating your duty

   The amount of duty you pay depends on the property’s purchase price or
   market value (being the greater of).
     * If you buy a property that already has a building on it, you
       pay duty on the combined value of the house and the land. This
       includes a home purchased under the land rent scheme.
     * If you buy a block of land that doesn’t have a house on it, but the
       seller is building one on the land before you settle as part of
       your contract, you still pay duty on the combined value of the
       house and the land. Examples include house-and-land packages and
       off-the-plan property purchases.

   If you buy land under one contract and arrange to build a house on the
   land under a separate contract, you pay duty on the land contract only.
   This also includes land under the land rent scheme.

   Duty rates and thresholds depend on the date of your transaction. The
   transaction date is the date of the grant, transfer or agreement for
   transfer – whichever comes first. It’s not the settlement date.

Getting assistance

   If you’re buying a home, land or both, you may be eligible for a stamp
   duty concession through one of the following:
     * [13]Home Buyer Concession Scheme,
     * [14]Pensioner Duty Concession Scheme,
     * [15]Disability Duty Concession Scheme.

   Under certain circumstances, you may also be eligible to [16]defer your
   duty payment or be eligible for an [17]exemption.

   Once you determine your eligibility you can claim it on the forms you
   lodge at Access Canberra. If we need to see your supporting documents,
   we’ll contact you after the transaction is finished.

Proof of identity

   Access Canberra requires you provide proof of your identity through a
   [18]Buyer Verification Declaration before you lodge the transfer. All
   identification must be valid and current.

   Individuals (including individuals as trustees) must provide details
   from two different identification documents: primary and secondary.
   Foreign citizens holding a visa must supply visa details.

   Companies and corporate trustees must provide an ABN.

Primary identification

     * Australian or overseas birth certificate
     * Australian or overseas passport
     * Australian citizenship certificate
     * [19]ImmiCard

Secondary identification

     * Australian or overseas birth certificate
     * Australian or overseas passport
     * Australian citizenship certificate
     * [20]ImmiCard
     * Australian driver licence
     * Medicare card
     * Australian visa

Paying duty

   Duty is payable 14 days after when the title to your property is
   registered at Access Canberra (the end of the transaction), rather than
   when you exchange contracts (the beginning of the transaction).

   After the settlement date of your contract, you have (and your agent
   has) 14 days to lodge your transfer instrument for title registration
   with Access Canberra. Penalty tax may be applied if the transfer is
   lodged late.

   Remember you will need to complete the [21]Buyer Verification
   Declaration before you lodge the transfer instrument at Access
   Canberra. Don’t forget to claim your owner-occupier rate, concession or
   exemption, if you’re eligible, by entering the [22]concession code
   number on the Buyer Verification Declaration before you lodge for
   registration.

   Once Access Canberra accepts and registers your title, we’ll email a
   Notice of Assessment to you* and your agent, if applicable. The Notice
   of Assessment will state:
     * the parties to the transaction
     * details of the transaction
     * how much duty you must pay
     * payment options
     * your unique payment reference number.

   *If there are two or more taxpayers, we’ll email the notice to the
   person whose name appears first on the transfer (that is, to the
   contact address listed on the Buyer Verification Declaration).

   If you’ve claimed an owner occupier rate, concession or exemption, it
   will show up on the notice as a reduced amount of duty. You’ll be
   advised of your ongoing eligibility requirements if it’s relevant (e.g.
   residency requirements).

   Payment must be made in 14 days and can be made by BPAY or Electronic
   Funds Transfer. [23]Interest applies to late payments. As conveyance
   duty is a known cost of purchasing a property, the Revenue Office
   expects payments to be made on time and does not provide payments plans
   for conveyance duty.

   You’ll need to keep all records of the transaction for at least five
   years after settlement, in case we request copies. Be sure that all the
   details on your transfer and other documentation are true and correct;
   giving false or misleading information is a serious offence. If you’ve
   underpaid duty, we may impose interest or penalty tax.

Transactions before 18 September 2017

   Different rules apply to transactions where you signed the contract
   before 18 September 2017. See the [24]Transactions before 18 September
   2017 page for more information.
