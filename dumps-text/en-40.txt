   November 10, 2023

   Call of Duty is a [229]video game series and [230]media franchise
   published by [231]Activision, starting in 2003. The games were first
   developed by [232]Infinity Ward, then by [233]Treyarch and
   [234]Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and handheld games were made
   by other developers. The most recent title, [235]Call of Duty: Modern
   Warfare III, was released on November 10, 2023.

   The series originally focused on the World War II setting, with
   Infinity Ward developing [236]Call of Duty (2003) and [237]Call of Duty
   2 (2005) and [238]Treyarch developing [239]Call of Duty 3 (2006).
   [240]Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) introduced a modern setting,
   and proved to be the breakthrough title for the series, creating the
   Modern Warfare sub-series; a [241]Modern Warfare remastered version
   released in 2016. Two other entries, [242]Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and
   [243]Modern Warfare 3 (2011), were made. The sub-series received a
   reboot with [244]Modern Warfare in 2019, [245]Modern Warfare II in
   2022, and Modern Warfare III in 2023. Infinity Ward have also developed
   two games outside of the Modern Warfare sub-series, [246]Ghosts (2013)
   and [247]Infinite Warfare (2016).

   Treyarch made one last World War II-based game, [248]World at War
   (2008), before releasing [249]Black Ops (2010) and subsequently
   creating the Black Ops sub-series. Four other entries, [250]Black Ops
   II (2012), [251]Black Ops III (2015), [252]Black Ops 4 (2018), and
   [253]Cold War (2020) were made, the latter in conjunction with
   [254]Raven Software. Sledgehammer Games, who were co-developers for
   Modern Warfare 3, have also developed three titles, [255]Advanced
   Warfare (2014), [256]Call of Duty: WWII (2017), and [257]Vanguard
   (2021). They are also the lead developer for Modern Warfare III (2023),
   the third entry in the Modern Warfare reboot sub-series.

   As of April 2021^[258][update], Call of Duty has sold over 400 million
   copies.^[259][1] The series is verified by the [260]Guinness World
   Records as the best-selling first-person shooter game series. It is
   also the most successful video game franchise created in the United
   States and the fourth [261]best-selling video game franchise of all
   time. Other products in the franchise include a line of [262]action
   figures designed by [263]Plan B Toys, a [264]card game created by
   [265]Upper Deck Company, Mega Bloks sets by [266]Mega Brands, and a
   [267]comic book miniseries published by [268]WildStorm Productions, and
   a feature film in development.

Esports

   The Call of Duty games were used in [563]esports, starting in 2006,
   alongside the game released at the time, [564]Call of Duty 4: Modern
   Warfare.^[565][83] Over the years, the series has extended with
   releases such as [566]Call of Duty: World at War, [567]Call of Duty:

   Modern Warfare 3, [570]Call of Duty: Black Ops II, [571]Call of Duty:
   Ghosts, and [572]Call of Duty: Mobile. Games are played in leagues like
   [573]Major League Gaming.

   Players can compete in ladders or tournaments. The ladders are divided
   into several sub ladders such as the singles ladder, doubles ladder,
   team ladder (3v3 – 6v6) and hardcore team ladder (3v3 – 6v6). The
   difference between the regular team ladder and the hardcore team ladder
   is the in-game settings and thus a rule differentiation. Winning ladder
   matches on a competitive website rewards the user with experience
   points which add up to give them an overall rank.^[574][84]

   The tournaments offered on these websites provide players with the
   opportunity to win cash prizes and trophies. The trophies are
   registered and saved on the player's profile if/when they win a
   tournament, and the prize money is deposited into his or her bank
   account. Call of Duty: Ghosts was the most competitively played game in
   2014, with an average of 15,000 teams participating every
   season.^[575][85]

   For the past 6 seasons in competitive Call of Duty, [576]Full Sail
   University has hosted a prize giveaway, giving $2,500 to the top team
   each season.^[577][86] The other ladders give out credits and medals
   registered on players' profiles. Tournaments hosted on the Call of
   Duty: Ghosts's Arena give cost from 15 to 30 credits, thus averaging at
   a cost of about $18.75 per tournament. If the player competes with a
   team, the prize money is divided, and an equal cut is given to each
   player. Other tournaments with substantial prizes are hosted in
   specific cities and countries for [578]LAN teams.

   The biggest Call of Duty tournament hosted was [579]Call of Duty:
   Experience 2011, a tournament that began when Call of Duty: Modern
   Warfare 3 was released.^[580][87]

   Playing Call of Duty competitively is most popular in Europe and North
   America, with users who participate in tournaments and ladder matches
   daily.^[581][88]

Call of Duty Endowment

   The [598]Call of Duty Endowment (CODE) is a nonprofit foundation
   created by Activision Blizzard to help find employment for U.S.
   military veterans. The first donation, consisting of $125,000, was
   presented to the [599]Paralyzed Veterans of America.^[600][90]

   Co-chairman General [601]James L. Jones is a former [602]U.S. National
   Security Advisor.^[603][91] Founder [604]Robert Kotick is the CEO of
   Activision Blizzard. Upon its founding in 2009, the organization
   announced a commitment to create thousands of career opportunities for
   veterans, including those returning from the [605]Middle
   East.^[606][92] Annual awards given by the endowment include the "Seal
   of Distinction", a $30,000 initial grant given to selected veteran's
   service organizations.^[607][93] In November 2014, the endowment
   launched the "Race to 1,000 Jobs" campaign to encourage gamers to
   donate money to and get involved in organizations that provide veterans
   with services.^[608][94] As of 2015^[609][update], the Call of Duty
   Endowment had provided around $12 million in grants to veterans'
   organizations in the United States, which has helped find jobs for
   14,700 veterans.^[610][95]

   On March 30, 2010, CODE presented 3,000 copies of Call of Duty: Modern
   Warfare 2, approximately $180,000 in value, to the [611]U.S. Navy. The
   copies were delivered to over 300 ships and submarines as well as Navy
   Morale, Welfare, and Recreation facilities worldwide.^[612][96]

Controversies and legal matters

  Modern Warfare 2 controversies

   Main articles: [613]Controversies surrounding Call of Duty: Modern
   Warfare 2 and [614]No Russian

   Modern Warfare 2 on release had a number of controversial matters. Most
   significantly, the level "[615]No Russian" had the player experience a
   massacre of civilians at a Russian airport.

  Fallout with Infinity Ward leadership

   Main article: [616]Infinity Ward

   As Infinity Ward's founders Jason West and Vince Zampella started new
   contract negotiations to continue developing the Call of Duty
   Activision around 2007, a number of legal issues arose between Infinity
   Ward and Activision. Ultimately, West and Zampella were forced out of
   Infinity Ward, later forming [617]Respawn Entertainment within
   [618]Electronic Arts. West and Zampella, as well as several Infinity
   Ward staff that departed the studio alongside them to join Respawn,
   filed lawsuits against Activision related to unpaid royalties and
   bonuses.

  Trademark infringement claims by AM General

   [619]AM General, the manufacturer of the [620]Humvee, sued Activision
   in 2017 for using the Humvee in multiple Call of Duty games.^[621][97]
   A federal district judge gave Activision a summary motion in its favor
   to dismiss the case in April 2020, stating that the purpose of the use
   of the Humvee in the games, to provide military realism, was quite
   different from the trademark purpose that AM General had established,
   for selling to the military.^[622][98]
