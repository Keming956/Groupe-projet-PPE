Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD)

   The Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD) can help you pay for
   education and training programs. If you’ve served at least 2 years on
   active duty, find out if you qualify for the MGIB-AD program.

Am I eligible for education benefits through the MGIB-AD program?

   You may be eligible for education benefits through this program if you
   were honorably discharged and you meet the requirements of one of these
   categories.

One of these categories must describe you

Category I

   All of these are true:
     * You have a high school diploma, GED, or 12 hours of college credit,
       and
     * You entered active duty for the first time after June 30, 1985, and
     * You had your military pay reduced by $100 a month for the first 12
       months of service

   And you’ve served continuously (without a break) for at least one of
   these time periods:
     * 3 years, or
     * 2 years if that was your agreement when you enlisted, or
     * 4 years if you entered the Selected Reserve within a year of
       leaving active duty (called the 2 by 4 program)

Category II

   All of these are true:
     * You have a high school diploma, GED, or 12 hours of college credit,
       and
     * You entered active duty before January 1, 1977 (or before January
       2, 1978, under a delayed enlistment program contracted before
       January 1, 1977), and
     * You served at least 1 day between October 19, 1984, and June 30,
       1985, and stayed on active duty through June 30, 1988 (or through
       June 30, 1987, if you entered the Selected Reserve within 1 year of
       leaving active duty and served 4 years), and
     * You had at least 1 day of entitlement left under the Vietnam Era GI
       Bill (Chapter 34) as of December 31, 1989

Category III

   All of these are true:
     * You have a high school diploma, GED, or 12 hours of college credit,
       and
     * You don’t qualify for MGIB under categories I or II, and
     * You had your military pay reduced by $1,200 before separation

   And one of these is true:
     * You were on active duty on September 30, 1990, and involuntarily
       separated (not by your choice) after February 2, 1991, or
     * You involuntarily separated on or after November 30, 1993, or
     * You chose to voluntarily separate under either the Voluntary
       Separation Incentive (VSI) program or the Special Separation
       Benefit (SSB) program

Category IV

   Both of these are true:
     * You have a high school diploma, GED, or 12 hours of college credit,
       and
     * You had military pay reduced by $100 a month for 12 months or made
       a $1,200 lump-sum contribution (meaning you paid it all at once)

   And one of these is true:
     * You were on active duty on October 9, 1996, had money left in a
       VEAP account on that date, and chose MGIB before October 9, 1997,
       or
     * You entered full-time National Guard duty under title 32, USC,
       between July 1, 1985, and November 28, 1989, and chose MGIB between
       October 9, 1996, and July 9, 1997

How does VA determine how much money I’ll receive?

   The amount you’ll receive depends on these factors:
     * Your length of service, and
     * The type of education or training program you choose, and
     * Your category (I, II, III, or IV), and
     * Whether you qualify for a college fund or kicker, and
     * How much you’ve paid into the $600 Buy-Up program
       Learn more about the $600 Buy-Up program

   Note: You usually have 10 years to use your MGIB-AD benefits. This may
   change depending on your situation.

How do I get these benefits?

   Follow the steps here to apply for these benefits.
    1. Make sure we’ve approved your program
       Before you enroll, contact the school or use the GI Bill Comparison
       Tool to find out if we’ve approved your program for VA education
       benefits. If you have questions, call us at 888-442-4551 (TTY:
       711). We’re here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET.
       Or submit a question online through Ask VA.
       Use the GI Bill Comparison Tool
       Contact us online through Ask VA
       Note: If you want to enroll in a program that we haven’t approved,
       you’ll need to ask the school to request approval. We can’t take
       any action until an official from your school (not you) requests
       approval. If we don’t approve your program, you’ll have to pay all
       costs at the school, including tuition and fees.
    2. Apply for benefits
       You can submit your Application for VA Benefits (VA Form 22-1990)
       online.
       Apply online now
       You can also apply by mail, in person, or with the help of a
       trained professional.
       Learn more about other ways to apply
    3. Ask your school or training program to certify your enrollment
       The certifying official may be someone in your school’s financial
       aid, Veterans Affairs, registrar, admissions, or counseling office.
       For on-the-job training or an apprenticeship, the official may be
       someone in your school’s training, finance, or human resources
       office.
       Note: You’ll then need to verify your enrollment at the end of each
       month to keep receiving payments. You can verify your enrollment
       online through our Web Automated Verification system (called
       “WAVE”) or by phone by calling 877-823-2378 (TTY: 711).

How can I use my MGIB-AD education benefits?

   You can use your GI Bill benefits in many ways to advance your
   education and training.
   Find out how to use your GI Bill benefits

   In some cases, we may help you pay for:
     * Remedial courses (classes some students must take to build up their
       basic skills in math, reading, or English before they can take
       regular college courses)
     * Deficiency courses (classes some students must take in order to be
       admitted to a certain college)
     * Refresher courses (brief courses that help people review and
       improve their knowledge in a certain subject area)

What if I qualify for other VA education benefits too?

   You can use only 1 education benefit for a period of service. You’ll
   have to choose which education benefit you’d like to use.
   Compare VA education benefits
   Once you choose an education benefit, you can’t change your mind and
   use a different education benefit.

   If you choose to use the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) instead of the
   Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD or Chapter 30), you can’t
   switch at some later date to use MGIB-AD. If you decide to use the
   Post-9/11 GI Bill, we’ll refund you part or all of the payments you
   made into MGIB-AD.

   Learn more about Montgomery GI Bill refunds

   If you have only 1 period of service that begins on or after August 1,
   2011, and you start receiving payments for MGIB-AD, you may lose your
   eligibility for the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

   You can also get help deciding which education benefits to use by
   calling us at 888-442-4551 (TTY: 711). We’re here Monday through
   Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET.

How many total months of VA education benefits can I get?

   You may be able to get a maximum of 48 months of VA education
   benefits—not including Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E)
   benefits. But many applicants are eligible for only 36 months.

How can I get more information?
