   The Office for Students (OfS) monitors what higher education providers
   do to prevent people being drawn into terrorism.

What is the Prevent duty?

   The Prevent duty aims to safeguard people from becoming terrorists or
   supporting terrorism.

   The government created [45]two sets of statutory guidance to support
   the strategy, one of which is specifically for higher education bodies.

   [46]The government has set out our monitoring role under the Counter
   Terrorism and Security Act 2015.

What do providers have to do?

   To comply with the Prevent duty, providers need to:
     * assess the risks associated with Prevent and draw up a plan to
       mitigate these
     * have effective welfare support systems, linking to DfE Prevent
       coordinators, local authorities or the police if necessary
     * have systems for assessing and mitigating risks around external
       speakers and events on campus, while maintaining the existing duty
       to promote freedom of speech
     * arrange ongoing Prevent training for relevant staff
     * have an IT usage policy, and where appropriate a research policy,
       which cover the Prevent duty
     * engage with students and ensure that students' unions and societies
       are aware of policies concerning activities on campus.

Does Prevent apply to my organisation?

   The Prevent duty applies to the governing bodies or proprietors of
   ‘relevant higher education bodies’ (RHEBs).

   Under the OfS, RHEBs are defined as:
     * providers that are registered with the OfS
     * providers that are not registered but have more than 250 higher
       education students - we define higher education students as those
       studying on a course that leads to a recognised higher education
       award in Schedule 6 of the Education Reform Act (1988)
     * providers that are designated for student support (e.g. for the
       purposes of ‘teach out’)
     * all the autonomous colleges, schools and halls of the Universities
       of Cambridge, Durham and Oxford.

Further education colleges

   Ofsted, rather than the OfS, is responsible for monitoring the
   implementation of the Prevent duty by further education or sixth-form
   colleges.
