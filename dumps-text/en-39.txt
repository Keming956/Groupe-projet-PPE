Reducing CO₂ emissions from heavy-duty vehicles

   Page contents
   (BUTTON)

   Lorries, buses and coaches are responsible for more than a quarter of
   GHG emissions from road transport in the EU, and for over 6% of total
   EU GHG emissions. Despite some improvements in fuel consumption
   efficiency in recent years, these emissions are still rising, mainly
   due to increasing road freight traffic.

   To fight the climate crisis, we need to bring down CO[2] emissions in
   this field. To do so, the Commission is proposing new targets which
   will raise our ambition and meet the EU’s climate and zero pollution
   objectives while [74]lowering demand for fossil fuels.

Raising our ambition

   In 2023, the Commission proposed a [75]revision of the Regulation on
   CO[2] emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles. If adopted, the
   proposal would introduce new, stronger CO[2] emission standards for
   heavy-duty vehicles from 2030 onwards, and extend the scope of the
   Regulation to cover smaller trucks, city buses, long-distance buses and
   trailers.
   Previous targets: 2025 -15%, 2030 -30%. New targets: 2030 -45%, 2035
   -65%, 2040 -90%.

   To stimulate faster deployment of zero-emission buses in cities, the
   Commission also proposes to make all new city buses zero-emission as of
   2030.

   The new targets build on those adopted in 2019, which were the
   first-ever EU-wide CO[2] emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles.

   To enter into force, the Commission’s proposal now needs to be adopted
   by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.

Main benefits

   If adopted, our proposal will:
   hdv_icon_decrease
   Decrease CO[2] emissions per km from new HDV by 90% by 2040, as
   compared to the reference period (1 July 2019 – 30 June 2020), with
   intermediate targets for 2030 (45%) and 2035 (65%)
   hdv_icon_neutrality
   Help reach the EU's 2050 climate neutrality target and boost
   zero-emission mobility
   hdv_icon_health
   Improve air quality and health of Europeans by cutting the level of air
   pollutants, especially in towns and cities
   hdv_icon_cost
   Reduce the fuel expenditure and total cost of ownership for transport
   operators and all users
   hdv_icon_dependency
   Lower the EU’s energy dependency on imported fossil fuels, and enhance
   energy savings and efficiency in the transport sector
   hdv_icon_industry
   Provide a clear signal to industry to pursue a zero-emission pathway by
   investing in innovative zero-emission technologies
   hdv_icon_zero
   Increase the share of zero and low-emission vehicles in the market and
   accelerate the roll-out of recharging and refuelling infrastructure
   hdv_icon_innovation
   Strengthen the technological and innovation leadership of industry in
   the EU and create new jobs

Regulation on CO₂ emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles

   Until the revision is adopted, the [76]Regulation on CO2 emission
   standards for heavy-duty vehicles applies. This Regulation entered into
   force on 14 August 2019.

   As per the Regulation, from 2025 onwards, manufacturers will have to
   meet the targets set for the fleet-wide average CO[2] emissions of
   their new lorries registered in a given calendar year. Stricter targets
   will start applying from 2030 on.

   The targets are expressed as a percentage reduction of emissions
   compared to the EU average in the reference period (1 July 2019–30 June
   2020):
     * From 2025 onwards: 15% reduction
     * From 2030 onwards: 30% reduction

   The 2025 target can be achieved using technologies that are already
   available on the market. The 2030 target has been assessed as part of
   the review of the Regulation.

   As a first step, the CO[2] emission standards cover large lorries,
   which account for over 73% of all CO[2] emissions from heavy-duty
   vehicles.

Incentive mechanism for zero- and low-emission vehicles (ZLEV)

   The Regulation includes an incentive mechanism for
     * Zero-emission vehicles (ZEV), lorries without an internal
       combustion engine, or with an internal combustion engine that emits
       less than 1gCO[2 ]per kWh[]or per km;
     * Low-emission vehicles (LEV), lorries with a technically permissible
       maximum laden mass of more than 16t, with CO[2] emissions of less
       than half of the average CO[2] emissions of all vehicles in its
       group registered in the 2019 reporting period.

   To incentivise the uptake of ZLEV and reward early action, a
   super-credits system applies from 2019 until 2024, and can be used to
   comply with the target in 2025. A multiplier of 2 applies for ZEV, and
   a multiplier between 1 and 2 applies for LEV, depending on their CO[2]
   emissions. An overall cap of 3% is set to preserve the environmental
   integrity of the system.

   From 2025 onwards, the super-credits system is replaced by a
   benchmark-based crediting system, with a benchmark set at 2%. The 2030
   benchmark level will have to be set in the context of the 2022 review.

   As a result, the average specific CO[2] emissions of a manufacturer are
   adjusted downwards if the share of ZLEV in its entire new heavy-duty
   vehicles fleet exceeds the 2% benchmark, out of which at least 0.75
   percentage points have to be vehicles subject to the CO[2] targets,
   i.e. the largest vehicles. Each percentage point of exceedance of the
   benchmark will decrease the manufacturer’s average specific CO[2]
   emissions by one percent.

   In both systems, ZEV not subject to the CO[2] targets are accounted in
   the incentive mechanism. Buses and coaches are excluded from the
   scheme. The ZEV not subject to the CO[2] targets can contribute to a
   maximum of 1.5% CO[2] emissions reduction.

Cost-effective achievement of targets

   The Regulation includes several elements to support cost-effective
   implementation:
     * Banking and borrowing to take account of long production cycles,
       including a reward for early action, while maintaining the
       environmental integrity of the targets.
     * Full flexibility for manufacturers to balance emissions between the
       different groups of vehicles within their portfolio.
     * Vocational vehicles , such as garbage trucks and construction
       vehicles, are exempted due to their limited potential for
       cost-efficient CO[2] reduction.

Governance

   The following measures will ensure the effectiveness and enforcement of
   the targets. They are based on the experience from [77]cars and
   [78]vans :
     * Assess the robustness and representativeness of the reference CO[2]
       emissions as a basis for calculating the EU fleet-wide emissions
       targets.
     * Collect, publish and monitor real-world fuel consumption data
       reported by manufacturers, based on mandatory standardised fuel
       consumption meters
     * Introduce in-service conformity tests and mandate the reporting of
       deviations and the introduction of a correction mechanism
     * Apply financial penalties in case of non-compliance with the CO[2]
       targets. The level of the penalties is set to 4,250 euro per
       gCO[2]/tkm in 2025 and 6,800 euro per gCO[2]/tkm in 2030.

Monitoring and reporting of CO₂ emissions from heavy-duty vehicles

   The following measures enable the implementation of the emission
   standards:
     * [79]Certification Regulation on the determination of the CO[2]
       emissions and fuel consumption of new lorries
     * [80]Regulation (EU) 2018/956 on monitoring and reporting

   The monitoring and reporting Regulation mandates the following
   monitoring and reporting requirements (with data from 1 January 2019
   onwards): :
     * Member States monitor and report to the Commission information on
       the heavy-duty vehicles registered for the first time in the Union;
     * Lorry manufacturers monitor and report to the Commission CO[2]
       emission and fuel consumption data as determined pursuant to the
       certification Regulation for each new vehicle produced for the EU
       market. This information will be calculated using the Vehicle
       Energy Consumption Calculation Tool ([81]VECTO).

   The collected data on CO[2] emissions and fuel consumption, together
   with other relevant technical information on the vehicles, including
   the aerodynamic drag, is made publicly available by the [82]European
   Environment Agency on behalf of the Commission

   The new system complements the existing EU reporting system for cars
   and vans.

Vehicle Energy Consumption Calculation Tool (VECTO)

   VECTO is a simulation software that can be used cost-efficiently and
   reliably to measure the CO[2] emissions and fuel consumption of
   heavy-duty vehicles for specific loads, fuels and mission profiles
   (e.g. long haul, regional delivery, urban delivery, etc.), based on
   input data from relevant vehicle components.

   The tool has been developed by the Commission in close cooperation with
   stakeholders.
