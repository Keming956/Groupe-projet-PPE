Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty

Public Bodies’ Statutory Duty to Eliminate Discrimination, Promote Equality,
and Protect Human Rights of Staff and Service Users

   All public bodies in Ireland have responsibility to promote equality,
   prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees,
   customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies and
   plans. This is a legal obligation, called the Public Sector Equality
   and Human Rights Duty, and it originated in Section 42 of the Irish
   Human Rights and Equality Act 2014.

   Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty

Implementing the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty:

   To meet the core requirements of the Duty, you must Assess, Address and
   Report.
   Public Service Duty Wheel
    1. Assess
       A public body is required to set out in its strategic/corporate
       plan an assessment of the equality and human rights issues relevant
       to its purpose and functions, in a manner that is accessible to the
       public.
    2. Address
       A public body is required to set out in its strategic/corporate
       plan the policies, plans and actions to address issues raised in
       the equality and human rights assessment, in a manner that is
       accessible to the public.
    3. Report
       A public body is required to report annually on developments and
       achievements in regard to the equality and human rights issues and
       actions, in a manner accessible to the public, in its annual
       report.

Service Users & Staff

   The Duty protects the people to whom the public body provides services
   and the staff of the public body.

Strategic Planning Cycle

   The requirement to integrate the Duty in strategic plans and annual
   reports means that it is an ongoing obligation that must be monitored,
   reviewed, and developed in each strategic planning cycle.

   Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty

Section 42, Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014

   (1) A public body shall, in the performance of its functions, have
   regard to the need to—

   (a) eliminate discrimination,

   (b) promote equality of opportunity and treatment of its staff and the
   persons to whom it provides services, and

   (c) protect the human rights of its members, staff and the persons to
   whom it provides services.

   (2) For the purposes of giving effect to subsection (1), a public body
   shall, having regard to the functions and purpose of the body and to
   its size and the resources available to it—

   (a) set out in a manner that is accessible to the public in its
   strategic plan (howsoever described) an assessment of the human rights
   and equality issues it believes to be relevant to the functions and
   purpose of the body and the policies, plans and actions in place or
   proposed to be put in place to address those issues, and

   (b) report in a manner that is accessible to the public on developments
   and achievements in that regard in its annual report (howsoever
   described).

   (3) In assisting public bodies to perform their functions in a manner
   consistent with subsection (1), the Commission may give guidance to and
   encourage public bodies in developing policies of, and exercising, good
   practice and operational standards in relation to, human rights and
   equality.

   (4) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (3), the
   Commission may— (a) issue guidelines, or (b) prepare codes of practice
   in accordance with section 31, in respect of the development by public
   bodies of performance measures, operational standards and written
   preventative strategies for the purpose of reducing discrimination and
   promoting human rights and equality in the public sector workplace and
   in the provision of services to the public.

   (5) Where the Commission considers that there is evidence of a failure
   by a public body to perform its functions in a manner consistent with
   subsection (1) and that it is appropriate in all the circumstances to
   do so, the Commission may invite the public body to— (a) carry out a
   review in relation to the performance by that body of its functions
   having regard to subsection (1), or (b) prepare and implement an action
   plan in relation to the performance by that body of its functions
   having regard to subsection (1), or both.

   (6) A review or an action plan under subsection (5) may relate to— (a)
   equality of opportunity or human rights generally, or (b) a particular
   aspect of human rights or discrimination, in the public body concerned.

   (7) The Commission may, and, if requested by the Minister, shall,
   review the operation of subsection (1).

   (8) For the purposes of assisting it in carrying out a review under
   subsection (7), the Commission shall consult such persons or bodies as
   it considers appropriate.

   (9) Where the Commission carries out a review under subsection (7) it—
   (a) may, or (b) where the Minister has requested the review, shall,
   make a report of the review to the Minister and any such report shall
   include such recommendations as the Commission thinks appropriate.

   (10) The Commission shall cause a copy of the report to be laid before
   each House of the Oireachtas.

   (11) Nothing in this section shall of itself operate to confer a cause
   of action on any person against a

   public body in respect of the performance by it of its functions under
   subsection (1).
