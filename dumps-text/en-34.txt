   Public authorities who operate in England must consider what they can
   do to conserve and enhance biodiversity in England. This is the
   strengthened ‘biodiversity duty’ that the Environment Act 2021
   introduces.

   This means that, as a public authority, you must:
    1. Consider what you can do to conserve and enhance biodiversity.
    2. Agree policies and specific objectives based on your consideration.
    3. Act to deliver your policies and achieve your objectives.

Who must comply with the biodiversity duty

   You must meet the biodiversity duty if you are a public authority, such
   as a:
     * government department or public body
     * local authority or local planning authority
     * statutory undertaker – a business that has public authority duties
       for their land and delivers something of public importance

When to meet your biodiversity duty

   You must complete your first consideration of what action to take for
   biodiversity by 1 January 2024. You must agree your policies and
   objectives as soon as possible after this.

   You must reconsider the actions you can take within 5 years of when you
   complete your previous consideration.

   You can decide to do this more often, for example, you could reconsider
   your actions quarterly, annually, or every 5 years.

Consider relevant strategies

   You must check if these strategies will affect how your organisation
   complies with the biodiversity duty:
     * local nature recovery strategies
     * species conservation strategies
     * protected site strategies

   You must:
     * understand how/if they are relevant to your organisation
     * be aware of how these strategies affect land that you own or
       manage, or actions you could take to conserve and enhance
       biodiversity
     * consider how you could contribute to the strategy, where
       appropriate

Local nature recovery strategies

   These will be locally led strategies for nature and environmental
   improvement established by the Environment Act 2021. Each local nature
   recovery strategy will:
     * agree priorities for nature’s recovery
     * map the most valuable existing areas for nature
     * map specific proposals for creating or improving habitat for nature
       and wider environmental goals

   There will be around 50 local nature recovery strategies covering the
   whole of England with no gaps or overlaps.

   When the local nature recovery strategies are published, you will need
   to understand which ones are relevant to you and how you can contribute
   to them. These are likely to be the strategy, or strategies, for the
   areas in England you’re active in.

   Preparation of local nature recovery strategies is expected to begin
   across England from April 2023. You may want to consider how you could
   get involved in preparing and delivering them now. For example, you
   could contribute by acting on proposals to create or improve habitat on
   land you own or manage, or help someone else to do so. By including any
   positive actions you plan to take in the strategy, you can help improve
   their quality. It will also make it easier for you to show how you have
   fulfilled your duty.

   Guidance on how local planning authorities should consider local nature
   recovery strategies will be published when available.

Species conservation strategies

   Established by the Environment Act 2021, species conservation
   strategies aim to safeguard the future of the species that are at
   greatest risk. The strategies will find better ways to comply with
   existing legal obligations to protect species at risk and to improve
   their conservation status.

Protected site strategies

   Established by the Environment Act 2021, protected site strategies take
   a new approach to protecting and restoring species and habitats in
   protected sites. Protected site strategies will provide ways to
   overcome offsite pressures such as nutrient pollution in the wider
   catchment.

How your biodiversity duty helps achieve biodiversity goals and targets

   The action you take for biodiversity will contribute to the achievement
   of national goals and targets on biodiversity.

   The Environmental Improvement Plan (EIP23), published in January 2023,
   sets out government plans for significantly improving the natural
   environment.

   By 2030, the government has committed to:
     * halt the decline in species abundance
     * protect 30% of UK land

   By 2042, the government has committed to:
     * increase species abundance by at least 10% from 2030, surpassing
       2022 levels
     * restore or create at least 500,000 ha of a range of wildlife rich
       habitats
     * reduce the risk of species extinction
     * restore 75% of our one million hectares of terrestrial and
       freshwater protected sites to favourable condition, securing their
       wildlife value for the long term

Actions you could take

   The policies and objectives you set, and the action you take to achieve
   them, will depend on your functions as a public authority.

   Public authorities can give priority to areas of high biodiversity
   value, if appropriate.

   If you already have a strategy that monitors your environmental
   performance, you can include your biodiversity actions as part of this.

   Consider creating a new document if you do not have a suitable existing
   strategy. In it, you can record the actions you plan to take to meet
   your biodiversity objectives.

   As a core component of natural capital, biodiversity supports ecosystem
   services that benefit people and the economy. When thinking about what
   actions you could take as part of your duty, you could consider the
   value of taking a Natural Capital approach.

   If your public authority is involved with development plans and
   decisions, consider your biodiversity duty when you’re complying with
   requirements under:
     * strategic environmental assessment
     * environmental impact assessment
     * Habitats Regulations assessment

Manage land to improve biodiversity

   Consider how the land you manage could improve biodiversity. This
   includes green and blue spaces like:
     * allotments
     * cemeteries
     * parks and sports fields
     * amenity spaces and communal gardens
     * roadside and railway verges
     * field margins and hedgerows
     * rights of way and access routes
     * woodlands and nature reserves
     * canals and rivers
     * water-dependent habitats
     * estuaries and coastal habitats

   Small changes to how you manage these areas could create habitats for
   wildlife and ‘nature corridors’ that connect existing habitats. This
   allows species to move between habitats, maintain or increase
   populations and be more resilient to climate change.

   There are other things you can do to improve habitats, including:
     * using native and sustainably sourced trees when planting
     * creating dedicated spaces for wildlife
     * leaving dead wood safely in place in woodlands to provide
       additional habitat
     * maintaining planted trees to give them the best chance of survival
     * reducing the use of herbicides, pesticides, peat and water
     * implementing measures to prevent the spread of invasive species and
       plant disease

   These actions can save money while delivering benefits to biodiversity.

   If you own or manage large areas of land, consider promoting and
   encouraging nature-based solutions, restoration of natural processes
   and landscape recovery.

   Natural England has published the Green Infrastructure Framework -
   Principles and Standards for England. This includes planning, design
   and process guides.

Make space for wildlife

   You could create dedicated spaces to attract wildlife and enhance
   biodiversity. This is possible even if your public authority owns a
   single office building. It is important that these measures are
   appropriate to the location.

   You could:
     * build and install nest boxes for birds, bats and other animals
     * add green walls or roofs to existing or new buildings
     * plant native trees and shrubs
     * plant wildflowers for pollinators

   You can do more if you own or manage specific types of land. For
   example, if you own or manage:
     * school grounds – create gardens, ponds, meadows or woodlands to
       improve biodiversity and aid education
     * farmland – be aware of soil health, water use and waste management
       and encourage farmers to apply for agri-environment schemes and use
       pesticides appropriately.

   Check the list of priority habitats and species in the UK.

Enhance protected sites

   Sites that public authorities own or manage can be protected by other
   legislation. For example:
     * sites of special scientific interest
     * special areas of conservation or special protection areas
     * national nature reserves
     * local nature reserves and local sites
     * Ramsar sites (wetlands of international importance)

   You should already be helping to conserve and enhance biodiversity on
   this land. For example, public bodies already have a duty to take all
   reasonable steps to conserve and enhance sites of special scientific
   interest.

   The Environmental Improvement Plan set the expectation that all public
   authorities should ensure they have management plans in place by the
   end of 2023 to support their sites to reach favourable status.

   Authorities should produce those plans and work actively with Natural
   England and others to identify and implement the actions needed to
   improve site condition.

Actions in national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty

   Consider designated areas such as national parks or areas of
   outstanding natural beauty (AONB) as part of your biodiversity duty.
   This is important if you have functions in or close to a site
   designated as a national park or AONB. Improving nature in national
   parks or AONBs is an action that can enhance and conserve biodiversity.
   If appropriate to your public body, you could comply with your
   biodiversity duty by:
     * helping to develop and implement management plans for national
       parks or AONBs
     * making improvements to nature in these areas

Improve how you manage buildings

   Review how you manage buildings and the land around them. This could
   include considering:
     * whether you should remove vegetation around your buildings and if
       you do, when to do it
     * what chemicals you use on the premises
     * when you carry out maintenance work, to minimise disturbance to
       wildlife
     * whether you can reduce the use of energy and water to help reduce
       pollution and address the pressure it puts on wildlife

Educate, advise and raise awareness

   You can help the public understand biodiversity and why it’s important
   to conserve and enhance it. This can encourage land managers,
   businesses and the general public to take action to benefit
   biodiversity too.

   For your policies, objectives and actions, you could:
     * include the public in projects to improve biodiversity
     * feature biodiversity in public or internal communications
     * use libraries and museums to raise awareness of biodiversity
     * put information boards in green spaces or offer guided walks
     * include biodiversity considerations in advice for internal and
       external clients and service users
     * educate your staff on your biodiversity actions and why they’re
       important
     * raise public awareness of how their gardens can support
       biodiversity, for example by avoiding artificial grass

Review internal policies and processes

   All public authorities have internal policies and processes for staff
   and facilities that could affect biodiversity.

   Changes to internal policies and processes that can affect biodiversity
   are another way you can meet your duty. Policies you could review
   include:
     * transport – support sustainable travel to reduce carbon emissions
       and improve air quality
     * waste – review waste management and recycling processes to reduce
       water pollution and air pollution from waste transport and landfill
     * water – improve water efficiency to reduce the effect water
       abstraction can have on sensitive habitats and species
     * procurement – buy sustainable materials and supplies to reduce the
       demand on natural resources
     * light – make sure the design of artificial lighting minimises
       effects on nature

Prepare for biodiversity net gain

   Biodiversity net gain (BNG) is an approach to development or land
   management that aims to leave the natural environment in a measurably
   better state than it was beforehand. If your public authority does not
   have a biodiversity net gain policy in the local plan, you could
   consider preparing one.

   Future development projects (apart from exempt developments) will need
   to achieve a 10% biodiversity net gain. This is expected to be required
   from:
     * November 2023 for Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (TCPA)
       projects not falling under the small sites definition [footnote 1]
     * April 2024 for TCPA small sites
     * the end of 2025 for Planning Act 2008 (Nationally Significant
       Infrastructure Projects)

   Local planning authorities will need to report what is done for
   biodiversity net gain on and off development sites.

   Local planning authorities should consider areas that are appropriate
   for biodiversity net gain. Consider how existing planning advice and
   strategies can protect and enhance biodiversity.

   The developer is responsible for selecting the competent person for
   completing the small sites metric (SSM). The competent person does not
   need to be an ecologist for the SSM. The local planning authority does
   not need to verify the competent person.

   Find out about biodiversity net gain and how it affects you.

Get help with your actions

   You can get help from experts when considering what actions you can
   take. For example, you could:
     * commission a survey or audit to help assess your property and its
       potential to improve biodiversity
     * consult your local nature recovery strategy to find out what
       actions would benefit your area – preparation of these will begin
       in 2023
     * check existing data about wildlife and habitats in the area
     * speak to Natural England, Environment Agency, Forestry Commission,
       local wildlife trusts or consultant ecologists

   You can get existing local data from Local Environmental Record
   Centres. If you commission research, you can share that data with them.
   To help you understand habitats and species in your area, you can use
   the national Magic Map.

   Getting expert advice can help you understand how you can make a
   difference for biodiversity and avoid unintended outcomes.

   You may need to get expert environmental advice on planning before
   preparing plans or considering development proposals.

   Environmental assessment regulations require monitoring of the effects
   of development plans and projects. You could use the results of this
   monitoring as a source of environmental data.

Reporting your biodiversity policies and actions

   Some public authorities need to publish a biodiversity report.

   Local authorities (excluding parish councils) and local planning
   authorities must write and publish a biodiversity report. Other public
   authorities must fulfil their duty, but do not need to publish a
   report.

   For local authorities and local planning authorities, the end date of
   your first reporting period should be no later than 1 January 2026.

   After this, the end date of each reporting period must be within 5
   years of the end date of the previous reporting period.

   The report is a chance to communicate how your organisation is helping
   to improve the environment and show the positive change you’re making.

   Defra intends to include references to your biodiversity reports in the
   5-yearly reviews of the Environmental Improvement Plan.

   Defra’s reporting your biodiversity duty actions guidance gives
   information about when you must publish your report and what you need
   to include.

   Your biodiversity reports will:
     * help everyone understand how we are collectively meeting shared
       goals to conserve and enhance biodiversity
     * allow you to showcase the action you’re taking to improve
       biodiversity
     * show other authorities and the general public what they can do for
       nature recovery and share good practice

Footnotes

   1. For BNG exemptions, ‘small sites’ has 2 definitions.
