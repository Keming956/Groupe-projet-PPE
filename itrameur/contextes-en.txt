   duty suspensions are designed to help UK and Crown Dependency
   (Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey) businesses remain competitive in
   the global marketplace. They do this by suspending import duty on
   certain goods, normally those used in domestic production.

   These suspensions do not apply to other duty that may be chargeable
   like VAT or trade remedies duty, such as anti-dumping duty.

   duty suspensions allow unlimited quantities to be imported into the UK

Overview

   Conveyance duty, commonly known as stamp duty, is a tax you pay when
   you buy property in the ACT, whether it’s a home, land, or a commercial
   property.

   The Government is continuing to reduce conveyance duty rates for
   residential properties.

   Since 1 July 2021, eligible owner-occupiers of residential properties
   have paid a reduced rate of conveyance duty. On or after 1 July 2023,
   duty on owner-occupier purchases up to $260,000 will be at the lower
   rate of 0.49%.

   From 1 July 2023, commercial properties with a dutiable value of
   $1,800,000 or less will pay no conveyance duty. Where the value is
   greater than $1,800,000 a flat rate of 5 per cent will apply.

Calculating your duty

   The amount of duty you pay depends on the property’s purchase price or
   market value (being the greater of).
     * If you buy a property that already has a building on it, you
       pay duty on the combined value of the house and the land. This
       includes a home purchased under the land rent scheme.
     * If you buy a block of land that doesn’t have a house on it, but the
       seller is building one on the land before you settle as part of
       your contract, you still pay duty on the combined value of the
       house and the land. Examples include house-and-land packages and
       off-the-plan property purchases.

   If you buy land under one contract and arrange to build a house on the
   land under a separate contract, you pay duty on the land contract only.
   This also includes land under the land rent scheme.

   If you’re buying a home, land or both, you may be eligible for a stamp
   duty concession through one of the following:
     * [13]Home Buyer Concession Scheme,
     * [14]Pensioner duty Concession Scheme,

   Under certain circumstances, you may also be eligible to [16]defer your
   duty payment or be eligible for an [17]exemption.

     * details of the transaction
     * how much duty you must pay
     * payment options
     * your unique payment reference number.
--

   If you’ve claimed an owner occupier rate, concession or exemption, it
   will show up on the notice as a reduced amount of duty. You’ll be
   advised of your ongoing eligibility requirements if it’s relevant (e.g.
   residency requirements).
--
   Payment must be made in 14 days and can be made by BPAY or Electronic
   Funds Transfer. [23]Interest applies to late payments. As conveyance
   duty is a known cost of purchasing a property, the Revenue Office
   expects payments to be made on time and does not provide payments plans
   for conveyance duty.

   You’ll need to keep all records of the transaction for at least five

   details on your transfer and other documentation are true and correct;
   giving false or misleading information is a serious offence. If you’ve
   underpaid duty, we may impose interest or penalty tax.

Excise duty

   Depending on the goods you order, you may receive an invoice for excise

   courier. This invoice must be paid before the goods are handed over to
   you.

   See [81]how excise duty are  calculated in the EU Member States.

   declaration that is much lower than the actual price paid so that you
   don't have to pay duty and/or pay lower VAT. This may also result in
   seizure of the goods and/or additional costs and possible a fine at
   delivery.
--

   The VAT taxable amount is made up of the customs value plus taxes,
   duty, levies and other charges, such as shipping and insurance costs.

   Customs duty is typically calculated as a percentage of the customs
   value of the goods:

   The customs value is based on the price paid for the goods.

   Customs duty is not due for goods, provided directly to the buyer when
   their value does not exceed €150, excluding transport and insurance
   costs. This relief does not apply to perfumes and toilet waters,
   tobacco or tobacco products and alcoholic products which are subject to
   special duty-free limits on the quantity provided.

   In some cases, additional duty may be charged, depending on the
   country of manufacture of the goods. The [86]TARIC database covers all

   Members who accumulate 20 or more years of active service are eligible
   for retirement. There are three non-disability retirement plans
   currently in effect for active duty retirees. These are Final Pay plan,
   High-36 Month Average plan, and Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986
   (more commonly referred to as REDUX) plan.
--

   The Final Pay plan uses a multiplier % that is 2.5% times the years of
   creditable service. The years of creditable service for an active duty
   retirement calculation is the sum of years of active service (i.e.,
   active duty or full-time National Guard duty) and any additional years
   computed by adding all reserve points, if any (except those for active
   service)and dividing by 360.
--
REDUX Plan

   The REDUX retirement plan is an option available only to active duty
   members who entered service on or after August 1, 1986. It includes a
   $30,000 Career Status Bonus (CSB).
--

   The years of creditable service for computation of the retired pay
   percentage multiplier include all active duty and any credited reserve
   points divided by 360.

   [77]duty to accommodate

Page content

   Under the Code, employers and unions, housing providers and service
   providers have a legal duty to accommodate the needs of people with
   disabilities who are adversely affected by a requirement, rule or
   standard. Accommodation is necessary to ensure that people with
--
     must accommodate the employee in a way that, while not causing the
     employer undue hardship, will ensure that the employee can work. The
     purpose of the duty to accommodate is to ensure that persons who are
     otherwise fit to work are not unfairly excluded where working
     conditions can be adjusted without undue hardship.
--
     The test is not whether it was impossible for the employer to
     accommodate the employee's characteristics. The employer does not
     have a duty to change working conditions in a fundamental way, but
     does have a duty, if it can do so without undue hardship, to arrange
     the employee's workplace or duty to enable the employee to do his
     or her work.^[78][120]

--
   education and employment).^[79][121]

   The duty to accommodate has both a substantive and a procedural
   component. The procedure to assess an accommodation (the process) is as
   important as the substantive content of the accommodation (the
--
   said: “a failure to give any thought or consideration to the issue of
   accommodation, including what, if any, steps could be taken constitutes
   a failure to satisfy the ‘procedural’ duty to accommodate.”^[81][123]

   In Ontario, it is clear that a failure in the procedural duty to
   accommodate can lead to a finding of a breach of the Code even if there
   was no substantive accommodation that could have been provided short of
   undue hardship. Failure to perform either component of the duty is a
   failure to carry out the duty to accommodate.^[82][124]

   Moreover, an organization will not be able to argue persuasively that
   providing accommodation would cause undue hardship if it has not taken
   steps to explore accommodation solutions, and otherwise fulfil the
   procedural component of the duty to accommodate.^[83][125]

     Example: In one case, a human rights tribunal upheld a claim of
--
8.1 Principles of accommodation

   The duty to accommodate is informed by three principles: respect for
   dignity, individualization, as well as integration and full
   participation.
--
   person.”^[85][127]

   The duty to accommodate people with disabilities means accommodation
   must be provided in the way that most respects the dignity of the
   person, if doing so does not cause undue hardship. Human dignity
--
   In addition to designing inclusively and removing barriers,
   organizations must respond to individual requests for accommodation.
   The duty to accommodate requires that the most appropriate
   accommodation be determined and provided, unless this causes undue

--
   expensive or less disruptive to the organization.^[108][150]

8.3.1 Essential duty and requirements

   Section 17 of the Code says that the right to be free from
   discrimination is not infringed if the person with a disability is
   incapable of performing or fulfilling the essential duty or
   requirements attending the exercise of the right.

   In employment, essential duty are the “vital” or “indispensable”
   aspects of someone’s job. In housing, the essential duty or
   requirements of being a tenant may include paying rent, maintaining
   one’s unit so it does not violate health and safety laws, and allowing
   other people to reasonably enjoy their premises. In the case of
   services, the “essential duty or requirements” of using a service
   will vary depending on the circumstances.

   Section 17 means that someone cannot be judged incapable of performing
   the essential duty of a job, or the essential requirements of being a
   tenant or taking part in a service, unless it can be shown that the
   person’s needs cannot be accommodated

   without undue hardship. An organization should not conclude that a
   person is unable to perform the essential duty without actually
   giving the person an opportunity to demonstrate their ability.

--

     Example: After coming back from a disability-related leave, a man
     returned to modified duty. Even though his doctor cleared him to
     go back to work full-time, his employer placed him in a lower,
     part-time position at a lower pay rate. He was eventually terminated
     from his employment. The HRTO found that the employer failed to meet
     both its procedural and substantive duty to accommodate. The
     employer violated the Code when it based its decision to place the
     employee in a lower-paying position on its belief about the
--
   necessary.^[112][154]

   The duty to accommodate does not require exempting a person from
   performing the essential duty of the job,^[113][155] requirements of
   the service, etc. In the context of employment, the duty to accommodate
   does not require an employer to fundamentally change the working
   conditions of employees, assign the essential duty of an employee
   with a disability to other employees or change the essential duty and
   requirements of a position.^[114][156] In these cases, a next-best
   solution, such as alternative work, may need to be found.

     Example: A delivery truck driver’s duty included loading skids of
     product onto a truck, and unloading them at his destination. He
     worked for a small operation whose staff consisted of the owner and
     his wife, a warehouse employee and the delivery truck driver. Due to
     a back injury, the driver was not able to load and unload the truck,
     an essential duty of his job. He requested light duty, preferably
     office work, or relief from loading and unloading the truck. The
     employer denied this request because there were no light duty
     available, and he could not hire an additional person to help the
     driver. The HRTO found that the duty to accommodate does not require
     an employer to assign the essential duty of an employee with a
     disability to other employees or to hire another employee to perform
     them in the employee's place. An employer is also not required to
     change the essential duty and requirements of a position so that
     an employee can meet them.^[115][157]

--
8.3.2.1 Alternative work

   There is a duty to accommodate a person in their pre-disability job
   wherever possible. However, it is recognized that this may not always
   be feasible. Human rights case law recognizes that employers have a
   duty to consider temporary and permanent alternative work for people
   who can no longer remain in their position even with
   accommodation.^[116][158] This duty includes diligently investigating
   positions and proposing job options^[117][159] that are within the
   person’s functional limitations.^[118][160]
--
   work.^[123][165]

   The duty to accommodate may include some workplace
   reorganization.^[124][166] For example, it may require employers to
   consider placing an employee with a disability into a vacant position
--
     positions available at the company. He is generally qualified for
     one of these positions, but does not know how to use a computer
     program that is required to do the essential duty of this job. The
     employer sends the person on a training course to learn the computer
     program. The employee is then qualified for the position.

   The duty to accommodate does not require the employer to completely
   alter the essence of the contract of employment, that is, the
   employee’s duty to perform work in exchange for
   remuneration.^[126][168] The duty to accommodate does not require an
   employer to provide “make work” or “to create a job that is not
   productive or that, in the employer’s view, does not need to be
--

   The right of people with disabilities to return to work exists if the
   worker can fulfil the essential duty of the job after accommodation
   short of undue hardship.^[133][175] If a person cannot fulfil the
   essential duty of the pre-disability job, despite the employer's
   effort to accommodate short of undue hardship, the employer still has
   an obligation to canvass alternative work possibilities, as outlined
--

   Under the Code, there is no fixed rule as to how long an employee with
   a disability may be absent before the duty to accommodate has been met.
   This will depend on the ability of the employee to perform the
   essential duty of the job considering the unique circumstances of
   every absence and the nature of the employee’s condition, as well as
   circumstances in the workplace.^[134][176] Also important is the
--
   recur and the frequency of the absence. The employee’s prognosis and
   length of absence are also important considerations. It is more likely
   that the duty to accommodate will continue with a better prognosis,
   regardless of the length of absence.

   The duty to accommodate does not necessarily guarantee a limitless
   right to return to work.^[135][177] On the other hand, a return to work
   program that relies on arbitrarily selected cut-offs or that requires
--

   The Supreme Court of Canada has set out a framework for examining
   whether the duty to accommodate has been met.^[138][180] If prima
   facie discrimination (or discrimination on its face) is found to exist,
   a respondent must establish on a balance of probabilities that the
--
   Employment
     * allowing a flexible work schedule^[143][185]
     * modifying job duty^[144][186]
     * modifying policies
     * making changes to the building (for example, installing ramps, hand
--
   Keeping in mind that everyone experiences disability differently,
   accommodation providers are also required to educate themselves about
   the nature and impact of disabilities as part of the procedural duty to
   accommodate,^[155][197] and to dispel any misperceptions or stereotypes
   that employees, other tenants or service staff or users may have about
--
     * bear the cost of required accommodation.

   Although the person seeking accommodation has a duty to assist in
   securing appropriate accommodation that will meet their needs, they are
   not responsible for originating a solution^[166][208] or leading the
--
   the co-operation of the person seeking accommodation. After
   accommodation is provided, the person receiving the accommodation is
   expected to fulfil the essential duty or requirements of the job,
   tenancy, or taking part in a service.

--
8.6.1 duty to inquire about accommodation needs

   In general, the duty to accommodate a disability exists for needs that
   are known or ought to be known. Organizations and persons responsible
   for accommodation are not, as a rule, expected to accommodate
--
     he was experiencing difficulties on the job due to his disability.
     Even though the man did not formally request accommodation, the HRTO
     stated “…the procedural duty to accommodate indicates that an
     employer cannot passively wait for an employee to request
     accommodation where it is aware of facts that indicate that the
     employee may be having difficulties because of disability; there is
     a duty to take the initiative to inquire in these
     circumstances.”^[173][215]

   Where an organization is aware, or reasonably ought to be aware, that
   there may be a relationship between a disability and someone’s job
   performance, or their abilities to fulfil their duty as a tenant or
   service user, the organization has a “duty to inquire” into that
   possible relationship before making a decision that would affect the
   person adversely.^[174][216] This includes providing a meaningful
--

   Where a person exhibits inappropriate behaviour due to a disability,
   employers, housing providers and service providers have a duty to
   assess each person individually before imposing measures that may
   affect the person negatively. Such measures might include prematurely
--
   and tenants that a disability-related assessment (such as a medical
   assessment) or accommodation can be provided as an option to address
   job performance issues or issues relating to fulfilling one’s duty as
   a tenant or a service user.

--

   Once disability-related needs are known, the legal onus shifts to those
   with the duty to accommodate.^[177][219] For example, support or
   referral through employee assistance programs (EAPs) could be the
   solution for an underlying disability.
--
   employees, tenants and service users.^[178][220] At the same time,
   organizations must have enough information to allow them to meet their
   duty to accommodate.

   As stated above, the person seeking accommodation is generally required
--
   accommodation in good faith.^[179][221] A person with a disability does
   not have to meet an onerous standard for initially communicating that a
   disability exists to trigger the organization’s duty to accommodate.
   Organizations should limit requests for information to those reasonably
   related to the nature of the limitation or restriction, to assess needs
--
     * that the person has a disability
     * the limitations or needs associated with the disability
     * whether the person can perform the essential duty or requirements
       of the job^[180][222], of being a tenant, or of being a service
       user, with or without accommodation
     * the type of accommodation(s) that may be needed to allow the person
       to fulfill the essential duty or requirements of the job, of
       being a tenant, or of being a service user, etc.
     * in employment, regular updates about when the person expects to

     sought further medical details of her condition, which she refused
     to provide. The Ontario Divisional Court stated that the co-op had a
     duty to respect the rights of its occupants under the Ontario Human
     Rights Code and to accommodate the needs of an occupant with a
     disability, to the point of undue hardship.^[181][223]
--
   ^[201][124] In Lane, supra note 6, the HRTO held at para. 150 that a
   failure to meet the procedural dimensions
   of the duty to accommodate is a form of discrimination in itself
   because it “denies the affected person
   the benefit of what the law requires: a recognition of the obligation
--
   stated at para. 186: “…while human rights principles include an
   acknowledgment that not every barrier can be eliminated, they also
   include a duty to prevent new ones, or at least, not knowingly to
   perpetuate old ones where preventable.” Organizations, including
   government, should design their programs, services and facilities
--
   para. 31.

   ^[150] The duty to accommodate does not require an employer to promote
   an employee to a higher-level position he or she would not otherwise
   have been entitled to: Ellis v. General Motors of Canada Ltd., 2011
   HRTO 1453 (CanLII). The duty to accommodate also does not require “an
   employer to place an employee in the position that the employee
   considers ideal…”: Seguin v. Xstrata Nickel, 2012 HRTO 15 (CanLII) at

   an employer to look far beyond the disabled employee’s own position as

   are or would be subject to the standard and whether there is a link
   between the standard and the duty of employees: Lauzon v. Ontario
   Provincial Police, 2011 HRTO 1404 (CanLII).

   ^[197] In Lane, supra note 6, a case involving an employee with a

   ^[200] In Baber, supra note 12, the HRTO found that even if the duty to
   accommodate was triggered,
   the employer had fulfilled its duty to accommodate because Ms. Baber
   failed to co-operate in the accommodation process by refusing
   reasonable requests for information that would confirm her needs. She
   consistently refused to provide the necessary medical information. The
   HRTO found that the employer did not breach its duty to accommodate her

   establishing a disability and outlining the accommodation needs on the

   the duty to accommodate – which includes obtaining all relevant
   information and considering how to accommodate – includes a
   responsibility to pay the costs necessary to facilitate accommodation,
--
     generally the focus should be on the functional limitations of the
     employee’s condition (capacities and symptoms) and how those
     functional aspects interact with the workplace duty and
     environment. Consequently, an employer need not be informed of the
     specific cause of the employee’s condition or the exact diagnosis in
--
   disability…may not know the exact nature and extent of that disability
   at the time they are experiencing the symptoms. In such circumstances,
   we cannot impose a duty to disclose a conclusive medical diagnosis.”
   Some people may present with a set of symptoms, but without a specific
   diagnosis. See Ball, supra note 56.

1. Introduction

   This part concentrates on goods liable to excise duty. It lists the
   rates of excise duty chargeable for the following:
     * wine and made-wine
     * beer
--
     * biofuels

   Use this guide with the [56]Trade Tariff: look up commodity codes, duty
   and VAT rates to help with commodity code numbers (for example, 2204 10
   11 for certain wines).

   This part also contains some information and reference about excise
   drawback and excise duty reliefs.

1.1 Important note on definitions

   The definitions used in this part are those prescribed for excise duty
   purposes only.

1.2 Background

   Excise duty is chargeable, in addition to any customs duty which may be
   due, on the goods described in this part. These goods may be either of
   UK origin, received in the UK following an intra EU movement or
   imported from outside the UK or EU.

   The duty falls due at the time when the goods leave any duty suspension
   arrangements, that is when:
     * they are released for consumption or otherwise made available for
--
   addition to the commodity description and code number each excisable
   item has allocated a tax type code number (for example, 451 for
   spirits). These identify the type and rate of excise duty payable. They
   are included in the tables listed in section [57]Wine and made-wine.
   [58]UK Trade Tariff: Box 47(a) tax type codes also lists tax codes

3. Beer

   Class or description Tax type code Rate of excise duty
   Made in UK (standard rate, that is, annual production more than 60,000
   hectolitres) 407 £19.08 for each hectolitre per 1% ABV charged to the
--
   respective proportionate charges for parts of hectolitres)

   Reduced rates of duty were introduced from 1 June 2002 for beer
   produced by independent breweries producing no more than 30,000
   hectolitres. For breweries producing between 5,000 and 30,000
   hectolitres, the following arithmetical formula is used to calculate
   the rate of duty.

   (Annual production — 2,500) ÷ annual production × standard rate of duty
   at the time concerned. This must be rounded up to the nearest penny.

   Reduced rates of duty were also introduced from 1 June 2004 for beer
   produced by independent breweries producing between 30,000 and 60,000
   hectolitres.

   The following arithmetical formula is used to calculate the rate of
   duty for these breweries.

   (Annual production — (2,500 — 8.3% ABV of annual production in excess
   of 30,000 hectolitres)) × standard rate of duty at the time concerned ÷
   annual production.

--
   beer.

   The duty is charged on alcoholic strength to one decimal place, for
   example 4.19% ABV becomes 4.1% ABV (ignore figures after the first
   decimal place).

   Low alcohol beverages made from malt exceeding 0.5% ABV but not
   exceeding 1.2% ABV are not liable to excise duty.

   Examples of beer-based beverages are set out in the section on [61]Low
   alcohol beverages which also shows the rate of excise duty for these
   products up to 5.5% ABV. Beer and spirits mixtures exceeding 1.2% ABV
   are liable to duty at the spirits rate. Beer mixtures containing
   dutiable liquors other than spirits and exceeding 5.5% ABV are liable
   at the appropriate made-wine rate.

   The Hydrocarbon Oil duty Act 1979 (HODA) specifies full rates of
   excise duty on mineral oils and rebates of duty. The effect of applying
   a rebate of duty to a full rate is to create a lower rate of duty.
   These lower rates are known as rebated rates. This mechanism increases
   the number of effective rates of mineral oils excise duty.

9.3 For the purpose of these duty

   ‘Hydrocarbon oil’ means petroleum oils, coal tar, and oils produced
--

   ‘Rebated oil’ means oil which has been delivered for home use on
   allowance of a rebate of excise duty under the Hydrocarbon Oil duty
   Act 1979, sections 11 and 14.

   Supplementary information about the duty on hydrocarbon oil.

   Eligibility for rebate, as set out, is restricted as follows.
--
   be observed are set out in [76]Excise Notice 179.

   The excise duty on hydrocarbon oil removed to a refinery, instead of
   being charged at the time of importation, is charged on the delivery of
   any goods from the refinery for home use, and is the same as that which
   would be payable on the importation of like goods. It is therefore
   allowed the same rebate as would be allowed on importation. Any customs
   duty chargeable is payable when the oil is taken into use at the
   refinery, whether as feedstock or otherwise.

   From 15 October 1993 the unit for calculation of duty on hydrocarbon
   oils is the standard litre, that is, litres at 15°C. If not already
   expressed in those terms quantities will need to be converted. Further
--

   It’s illegal for any person to mix any oil on which no rebate of excise
   duty has been allowed with:
     * fuel oil, gas oil, kerosene or light oil (including unleaded
       petrol) on which rebate of excise duty has been allowed
     * oil delivered without payment of excise duty

   except under and in accordance with either an approval granted by the

   Goods containing mineral oils as a part or ingredient of them are not
   liable to excise duty unless they are intended for use as substitutes
   for road fuels or as additives to road fuels or road fuel substitutes.
   Any articles imported for these purposes are chargeable with UK excise
   duty on 100% of their volume (not only on the percentage of mineral
   oil, if any, contained within them). The tax type codes and excise duty
   rates to be applied are the same as for the type of mineral oil which
   the product is intended to substitute for or is to be added to.

   Lubricating oils will not be charged with UK excise duty unless they
   are to be added to an additives package, in which case excise duty will
   be charged on the whole package.

Increases to tobacco duty rates from 22 November 2023

General description of the measure

   This measure sets out how tobacco duty will increase on 22 November
   2023.

Policy objective

   The government is committed to maintaining high tobacco duty rates.
   This is an established tool to reduce smoking prevalence and ensure
   that tobacco duty continue to contribute to government revenues.

   The ‘tobacco duty escalator’, which increases duty in line with the
   Retail Price Index (RPI) +2% at each Budget, was extended at Budget
   2020 until the end of the current Parliament. In addition, increasing
   the duty rate on hand-rolling tobacco above the duty escalator will
   narrow the gap between hand-rolling tobacco and cigarette duty rates.

Background to the measure

   As announced at Autumn Statement 2023, the duty rate on all tobacco
   products will increase by the tobacco duty escalator of 2% above RPI
   inflation. The duty rate for hand-rolling tobacco will rise by an
   additional 10%, to 12% above RPI inflation. These changes will apply
   from 6pm on 22 November 2023.
--
Operative date

   The new tobacco duty rates will have effect from 6pm on 22 November
   2023.

Current law

   The table of duty rates on tobacco products is in Schedule 1 to the
   Tobacco Products duty Act 1979 (TPDA).

--

   Legislation will be introduced in Autumn Finance Bill 2023 to increase
   the rates of duty on tobacco products. The legislation will amend
   Schedule 1 to the TPDA and makes consequential changes to the
   simplified calculations contained within the Travellers’ Allowances
--
Equalities impacts

   Due to differences in tobacco consumption, any change to tobacco duty
   will have equalities impacts. Men (14.6%)  are slightly more likely to
   smoke than women (11.2%).
--

   This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on fewer than 30
   manufacturers and importers. They will face an increase in tobacco duty
   rates that they are likely to pass on to consumers.

Manner of acquisitions

   Examples of property acquisition in which ad valorem stamp duty (i.e.
   BSD, ABSD and SSD, whichever applicable) is payable:
    1. By way of purchase e.g. acceptance to option to purchase, sale and
--
       settlement
          + Declaration of Trust / Trust Deed:
               o A fixed duty of $10 is payable on the Declaration of
                 Trust/Trust deed which does not result in a change in
                 beneficial interest in the property.
               o Where there is a change in beneficial interest in the
                 property, ad valorem stamp duty will be payable on the
                 Declaration of Trust / Trust Deed.
    3. By way of distribution in specie upon the winding up of a company*
--
   Where any beneficiary renounces his interest in a residential property
   that is transferred to be held on bare trust on or after 10 May 2022,
   the settlor will need to pay stamp duty i.e. BSD and ABSD on the
   transfer of the share of the residential property back to him, under
   Section 22C of the Stamp duty Act.
--
   purchaser upon execution of the document (and not later), the amount of
   discount may be deducted from the purchase price to determine the
   consideration for stamp duty purpose. This is provided that the nett
   price is still reflective of market value.

--
   (e.g. furniture voucher, rental guarantee, car or lucky draw), the
   value of benefit is not deductible from the purchase price for stamp
   duty purpose.

   If the cash or non- cash benefit is not stated in the document to be
   stamped, the value of the benefit is also not deductible from the
   purchase price for stamp duty purpose.

   The first instrument executed relating to a sale and purchase is liable
   to ad valorem duty (i.e. full duty). Subsequent document(s) relating to
   the same sale transaction are not liable to stamp duty.

Acquisition of property through an en-bloc purchase or “block” purchase

   Where multiple properties are acquired collectively, stamp duty will be
   calculated on the total purchase price of the multiple properties if:
    1. There is a single contract for the purchase of the multiple
--
       conditional on one another.

Stamp duty on a single contract for multiple properties

   Where there is a single contract for the purchase of multiple
   properties followed by individual documents for the purchase of each
   property, the single contract should be stamped at ad valorem duty
   based on the total purchase price.

Stamp duty on multiple documents

   Where there are multiple documents (with purchases which are dependent
   and conditional on one another), only one of the documents is required
   to be stamped at ad valorem duty, based on the total purchase price of
   all the related properties.

Can the contracting parties change the date of instrument to avoid paying
higher duty?

   No. The Commissioner of Stamp duty takes a serious view of any
   attempt to evade or reduce the incidence of duty. Evasion of duty
   is an offence under section 62 of the Stamp duty Act. Any person
   guilty of such an offence shall be liable on conviction to a fine of up
   to $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term of up to 3 years or to both.
   The Commissioner of Stamp duty may also disregard or vary any
   arrangements meant to evade or reduce the incidence of duty, and impose
   the duty (including late stamping penalties, if applicable) which would
   otherwise be payable.

Can I pay BSD using my Central Provident Fund (CPF) money?

   Using CPF funds to pay stamp duty is subject to the terms and
   conditions under the Private Properties and Public Housing Schemes. You
   may wish to check with CPF Board for more details.

Stamp duty when buying a vehicle

   Calculate how much stamp duty you'll pay if you are buying a new or
   used vehicle. Exemptions apply to eligible pensioners and some vehicle
   types.

What is stamp duty?

   Stamp duty is charged when registration is issued to a different person
   or corporation. The tax is collected by Transport for NSW on behalf of
   Revenue NSW.

   To calculate stamp duty, you need the vehicle's market value or how
   much you paid for it (whichever is higher).

   adverse effects. Or the country can launch its own investigation and
   ultimately charge extra duty (known as countervailing duty) on

   subsidy is prohibited, it must be withdrawn immediately. Otherwise, the
   complaining country can take counter measures. If domestic producers
   are hurt by imports of subsidized products, countervailing duty can be

   subsidy must be withdrawn or its adverse effect must be removed. Again,
   if domestic producers are hurt by imports of subsidized products,
   countervailing duty can be imposed.

   Some of the disciplines are similar to those of the Anti-Dumping

   only be charged after the importing country has conducted a detailed
   investigation similar to that required for anti-dumping action. There

   Dumping and subsidies together with anti-dumping (AD) measures and

   The reaction to dumping and subsidies is often a special offsetting
   import tax (countervailing duty in the case of a subsidy). This is
   charged on products from specific countries and therefore it breaks the
   GATT principles of [35]binding a tariff and treating trading partners
   equally ([36]MFN). The agreements provide an escape clause, but they
   both also say that before imposing a duty, the importing country must
   conduct a detailed investigation that shows properly that domestic
   industry is hurt.

   Guidance

Complying with the biodiversity duty

   As a public authority, understand what the biodiversity duty is and how
   to comply with it.

Contents

    1. [41]Who must comply with the biodiversity duty
    2. [42]When to meet your biodiversity duty
    3. [43]Consider relevant strategies
    4. [44]How your biodiversity duty helps achieve biodiversity goals and
       targets
    5. [45]Actions you could take
--
   Public authorities who operate in England must consider what they can
   do to conserve and enhance biodiversity in England. This is the
   strengthened ‘biodiversity duty’ that the Environment Act 2021
   introduces.

--
    3. Act to deliver your policies and achieve your objectives.

Who must comply with the biodiversity duty

   You must meet the biodiversity duty if you are a public authority, such
   as a:
     * [52]government department or public body
     * local authority or local planning authority
     * statutory undertaker – a business that has public authority duty
       for their land and delivers something of public importance

When to meet your biodiversity duty

   You must complete your first consideration of what action to take for
--

   You must check if these strategies will affect how your organisation
   complies with the biodiversity duty:
     * [53]local nature recovery strategies
     * [54]species conservation strategies
--
   positive actions you plan to take in the strategy, you can help improve
   their quality. It will also make it easier for you to show how you have
   fulfilled your duty.

   Guidance on how local planning authorities should consider local nature
--
   catchment.

How your biodiversity duty helps achieve biodiversity goals and targets

   The action you take for biodiversity will contribute to the achievement
--
   As a core component of natural capital, biodiversity supports ecosystem
   services that benefit people and the economy. When thinking about what
   actions you could take as part of your duty, you could consider the
   value of taking a [57]Natural Capital approach.

   If your public authority is involved with development plans and
   decisions, consider your biodiversity duty when you’re complying with
   requirements under:
     * [58]strategic environmental assessment
--

   You should already be helping to conserve and enhance biodiversity on
   this land. For example, public bodies already have a duty to take all
   reasonable steps to conserve and enhance sites of special scientific
   interest.
--

   Consider designated areas such as national parks or areas of
   outstanding natural beauty (AONB) as part of your biodiversity duty.
   This is important if you have functions in or close to a site
   designated as a national park or AONB. Improving nature in national
   parks or AONBs is an action that can enhance and conserve biodiversity.
   If appropriate to your public body, you could comply with your
   biodiversity duty by:
     * helping to develop and implement management plans for national
       parks or AONBs
--

   Changes to internal policies and processes that can affect biodiversity
   are another way you can meet your duty. Policies you could review
   include:
     * transport – support sustainable travel to reduce carbon emissions
--
   Local authorities (excluding parish councils) and local planning
   authorities must write and publish a biodiversity report. Other public
   authorities must fulfil their duty, but do not need to publish a
   report.

--
   5-yearly reviews of the Environmental Improvement Plan.

   Defra’s [74]reporting your biodiversity duty actions guidance gives
   information about when you must publish your report and what you need
   to include.

Guidance on the professional duty of candour

   Joint guidance with the General Medical Council on the duty of candour

Contents

     * Overview
     * [84]Read the professional duty of candour

   All healthcare professionals have a duty of candour – this is a
   professional responsibility to be honest when things go wrong.

   This [85]guidance on the professional duty of candour ([86]Cymraeg) was
   produced in collaboration with the General Medical Council and has been
   refreshed in March 2022.

   This guidance complements the joint statement on the professional duty
   of candour by professional healthcare regulators (October 2014) and
   section 14 of [87]the Code.

   It focuses not only on the duty to be open and honest with patients but
   also on the need to be open and honest within organisations in
   reporting adverse incidents or near misses that may have led to harm.

   Professionals, students and employers can find out more about the
   professional duty of candour and how to apply it in practice by
   watching our webinar which took place 25 April.

duty

/ˈdudi/
--
   [10]IPA guide

   Other forms: duty

   When you've done your duty, you've done what you're supposed to and met
   your responsibilities. Your sense of duty as a citizen might compel you
   to vote; it might also keep you from voting twice.

   A duty is an obligation, and we get new duty with new positions in
   life, like taking a job, or becoming a parent. You didn't realize one
   of your duty as club president would be cleaning up after meetings. A
   police officer or cab driver can be on-duty or off-duty. As an off-duty
   police officer, you might still feel it's your duty to stop a robbery.
   duty also means "tax," which is why people like shopping duty-free at
   the airport.

Reducing CO₂ emissions from heavy-duty vehicles

   Page contents
--

   In 2023, the Commission proposed a [75]revision of the Regulation on
   CO[2] emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles. If adopted, the
   proposal would introduce new, stronger CO[2] emission standards for
   heavy-duty vehicles from 2030 onwards, and extend the scope of the
   Regulation to cover smaller trucks, city buses, long-distance buses and
   trailers.
--

   The new targets build on those adopted in 2019, which were the
   first-ever EU-wide CO[2] emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles.

   To enter into force, the Commission’s proposal now needs to be adopted
--
   the EU and create new jobs

Regulation on CO₂ emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles

   Until the revision is adopted, the [76]Regulation on CO2 emission
   standards for heavy-duty vehicles applies. This Regulation entered into
   force on 14 August 2019.

--

   As a first step, the CO[2] emission standards cover large lorries,
   which account for over 73% of all CO[2] emissions from heavy-duty
   vehicles.

--

   As a result, the average specific CO[2] emissions of a manufacturer are
   adjusted downwards if the share of ZLEV in its entire new heavy-duty
   vehicles fleet exceeds the 2% benchmark, out of which at least 0.75
   percentage points have to be vehicles subject to the CO[2] targets,
--
       gCO[2]/tkm in 2025 and 6,800 euro per gCO[2]/tkm in 2030.

Monitoring and reporting of CO₂ emissions from heavy-duty vehicles

   The following measures enable the implementation of the emission

   onwards): :
     * Member States monitor and report to the Commission information on
       the heavy-duty vehicles registered for the first time in the Union;
     * Lorry manufacturers monitor and report to the Commission CO[2]
       emission and fuel consumption data as determined pursuant to the
--
   VECTO is a simulation software that can be used cost-efficiently and
   reliably to measure the CO[2] emissions and fuel consumption of
   heavy-duty vehicles for specific loads, fuels and mission profiles
   (e.g. long haul, regional delivery, urban delivery, etc.), based on
   input data from relevant vehicle components.

   This form of duty can be revoked in certain situations such as an
   airport's [166]duty-free shop. When customers patronize a duty-free
   shop, commodities that are usually taxed such as cigarettes and alcohol
   will not have a duty levied on them. Foreign visitors will then be able
   to purchase the goods at a lower [167]price compared to domestic
   citizens.

   There are limits and guidelines for shopping duty-free. The products
   purchased are intended to be taken out of the country where they were
   bought. Shoppers generally have to show their passports when making
   duty-free purchases.

   Travelers who make duty-free purchases may be required to declare to
   customs officials what they bought once they arrive back in their
   respective home countries. They may be required to show receipts for
   the purchases. Monetary limits on the value of duty-free purchases may
   be set. If the value exceeds the threshold, tariffs and local taxes may
   be imposed on the purchases.

   The U.S. Customs and Border Protection will outline the details
   regarding duty on a variety of products. Specific details are
   outlined for tobacco and alcoholic products as well as items being
   brought in from Cuba.﻿﻿

Special Considerations

   The term "duty" may also refer to any responsibilities—whether moral or
   otherwise—held by an individual. These are obligations that a
   person—especially someone in a position of authority—has to fulfill the
--
   [169]shareholders. This means that any course of action the CEO takes
   should be in the best interests of the company's shareholders. For
   example, a CEO's duty can include weighing whether or not a merger deal
   with a rival would provide adequate [170]shareholder value.

   This responsibility is also similar to a [171]fiduciary duty. A
   fiduciary duty is when an individual places their trust and reliance on
   another in regards to a monetary situation. For example, a financial
   adviser would have a fiduciary duty to their clients and must act in
   the best interest of their clients. The same would hold true for an
   executor of an estate. The fiduciary has a duty to take responsibility
   and make decisions that will benefit the client above anyone else.

   Fiduciary duty refers to the relationship between a fiduciary and the
   principal or beneficiary on whose behalf the fiduciary acts.

   The fiduciary accepts legal responsibility for duty of care, loyalty,
   good faith, confidentiality, and more when serving the best interests
   of a beneficiary. Strict care must be taken to ensure that

   A common example of [173]an agent/principal relationship that implies
   fiduciary duty is that between the executives of a company and its
   shareholders. The shareholders expect that the executives will make
   well-considered, prudent decisions on their behalf and in their best

   Attorneys can be sued for breaches of their fiduciary duty by
   clients. They are accountable to the court in which a client is
   represented when a breach occurs.
--
Controlling Stockholder/Company

   In certain circumstances, fiduciary duty may be required of a
   stockholder who possesses a majority interest in a corporation or who
   exercises control over its activities. A breach of fiduciary duty may
   result in personal legal liability for the controlling shareholder as
   well as directors and officers.
--
Types of Fiduciary duty

   Fiduciary duty may differ depending on the type of beneficiary that a
   fiduciary serves. However, in general, the legal and ethical
   obligations related to protecting the interests of beneficiaries
   include the following duty.

duty of Care
--
   This pertains to acting in the best interest of the beneficiary at all
   times, putting their well-being first and foremost. It includes the
   duty of the fiduciary to excuse themself from taking actions when
   there's a conflict of interest with the beneficiary's welfare.

duty of Good Faith

   This duty pertains to always acting within the law to advance the
   interests of the beneficiary. At no time should the fiduciary take
   actions that are outside of legal constraints.
--
   Fiduciaries must engage in completely forthright behavior, disclosing
   any and all relevant information that could have an impact on their
   ability to carry out their duty as fiduciary and/or on the well-being
   of a beneficiary's interests.

Breaches in Fiduciary duty

   Fiduciary duty are taken on by individuals and entities for various
   types of beneficiaries. Such relationships include, among others,
   lawyers acting for clients, company executives acting for stockholders,
--
   investors, and trustees acting for estate beneficiaries.

   An employee may even have a fiduciary duty to an employer. That is,
   employers have a right to expect that employees are acting in their
   best interests. For example, they are not sharing trade secrets, or
--
   from a competitor.

   These expectations may not be actual fiduciary duty but they may be
   spelled out in an employee handbook or contract clause.

   Case law indicates that breaches of fiduciary duty most often happen
   when a binding fiduciary relationship is in effect and actions are
   taken which violate or are counterproductive to the interests of a
--
Consequences of a Fiduciary Breach

   A breach of fiduciary duty can lead to a number of consequences. Not
   all of them are legal consequences.
    1. An accusation of a breach of fiduciary duty can hurt the reputation
       of a professional. A client can end a professional relationship
       because they do not trust in [176]a professional’s care of the
       required fiduciary duty.
    2. If a breach of duty case proceeds to the courts, steeper
       consequences can result. A successful breach of fiduciary duty
       lawsuit can result in monetary penalties for direct damages,
       indirect damages, and legal costs.
--
       a license, or removal from service.

   However, proving a breach of fiduciary duty is not always easy.

Elements of a Fiduciary Breach Claim
--
   A number of legal precedents and elements have been established to
   allow claims by those who have been harmed by a breach of fiduciary
   duty. Jurisdictions differ, but in general, the following four elements
   are essential if a plaintiff is to prevail in a breach of fiduciary
   duty claim.

A duty Existed

   The plaintiff must show that a legal fiduciary duty existed. Many
   professionals are obligated, legally and ethically, to conduct their
   businesses honestly. However, that doesn't mean that they are
   fiduciaries who must act solely in the interest of a particular client.
   A fiduciary duty is accepted as such by a fiduciary, typically in
   writing.

A Breach Occurred

   The plaintiff must show that a fiduciary duty was breached. The type of
   breach varies in every case. For example, if an accountant was sloppy
   in filling out a client's tax returns, and the client was slapped with
   an enormous fine for nonpayment, the accountant may be guilty of a
   breach of fiduciary duty. However, if the client was sloppy and failed
   to provide complete and necessary information, no breach occurred.

--
   The plaintiff must show that the breach of trust caused actual damage.
   Without damage, there is usually no basis for a breach of fiduciary
   duty case. The more specific a principal or beneficiary can be with
   facts of damage, the better.

--
   clearly a conflict of interest. However, a specific accounting relating
   to the loss to the beneficiary is needed to prove a breach of fiduciary
   duty.

Causation Was Proved

   Causation shows that any damages incurred by the plaintiff were
   directly linked with the actions taken in breach of fiduciary duty. In
   the above example of a property sale, the link appears to be clear.
   However, the trustee might argue that a quick sale was in the best
--

   If you suspect your [177]financial adviser is in breach of their
   fiduciary duty, you can file a complaint with [178]FINRA, the [179]SEC,
   or both. If your adviser has a professional certification, you can also
   notify the entity that provided the credential.
--
A duty of Loyalty

   One example of a breach in fiduciary duty case went to the Virginia
   Supreme Court in 2007.

--

   In this case, the question of whether the employees had a fiduciary
   duty to their former employer, and breached it, was fundamental to the
   appeal that brought the case to the state's highest court.

   The court affirmed the lower court's ruling that the employees owed
   Mario a duty of loyalty. In effect, it supported the claim of a breach
   of fiduciary duty, and a penalty of more than $1 million.

A Menswear Store vs. Ex-Employees

   In 2006, a high-end menswear store cited a breach of fiduciary duty
   when it sued two of its former sales professionals for taking a job
   with a competitor, Saks Fifth Avenue. The department store was able to
--

   The company sued the bank that took the deposits, alleging that it
   aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty. The court ruled that
   there was insufficient evidence that the bank was aware of its role in
   the scam.
--

   The adjective fiduciary means held or given in trust. In accepting a
   fiduciary duty, an individual or entity accepts a legal commitment to
   act in the best interests of a beneficiary.

What Are the Main Fiduciary duty?

   There are several types of fiduciary duty. One is the duty of loyalty
   which implies that the fiduciary will always act in the best interests
   of the beneficiary or principal. duty of care is another. It means that
--
   regarding a beneficiary's well-being. No conflicting interest will be
   permitted to influence the fiduciary's actions on behalf of the client.
   duty to disclose is a third. It refers to the duty a fiduciary has to
   disclose any conflict of interest they may have when acting on behalf
   of a beneficiary.
--
   acting for a principal.

   However, any individual may, in some cases, have a fiduciary duty to
   another person or entity. For example, an employee may be found to have
   a duty of loyalty to an employer and may be legally liable if they
   cause harm to the employer by misusing information or resources
   entrusted to them.
--
The Bottom Line

   Fiduciary duty refer to the ways that a fiduciary is legally
   committed to act for a principal or beneficiary. They include a duty of
   loyalty, a duty of care, a duty of prudence, a duty of confidentiality,
   and more.

   Fiduciary duty are meant to ensure that the fiduciary acts only in
   the best interests of a principal or beneficiary. What's more, the
   fiduciary must act diligently to protect those interests.
--
   fiduciary, you can protect yourself by understanding the rights that
   this relationship grants you and the responsibilities that are [180]not
   part of a fiduciary's duty.

     ABSTRACT: The public life of political servants is characterized by
     other duty and obligations than private life. Conflicts can even
     arise between a person's public and private duty. The central
     point of this paper is to examine whether this difference of duty
     can be regarded as an effect of different forms of obligation. Can
     we speak of a particular form of political obligation in the same
--
   All modern societies in some way accept the distinction between legal
   and ethical obligation. The former constitutes an exterior sphere of
   norms and rules, including duty which citizens can be compelled to
   perform by the threat of punishment or other legal consequences, the
   latter concerns the interior sphere of a person's conscience and
--
   change in morals': the evolution of a separate subjective sphere of
   morality within the public ethical life. (1) Legal and moral law oblige
   in different ways and also contain different duty. In modern society,
   legal duty usually take the form of commands and rules. The
   distinguishing characteristic of legal duty and corresponding rights
   is that they can be enforced by an appeal to the law. For the sake of
   certainty and to avoid arbitrariness, the legal system strives to
   formulate duty as unambiguously, completely and consistently as
   possible, and to determine the rules for their enforcement precisely.
   Thus, the question of what a legal obligation is and how the subjects
   under obligation must behave is virtually answered by the legal system
   itself. How to fulfill a moral duty, on the other hand, is considered a
   matter of ethical obligation and left to the conscience of private
   persons. Immanuel Kant thought that the domain of duty could be
   adequately divided into duty that can be the object of legal
   obligation, on the one hand, and duty that only can be the object of
   ethical obligation, on the other. The latter pertains to intentions;
   the former, to external aspects of the action. I think, however, that
--
   between political obligation and democratic political virtue.

   1. Moral duty and political necessity

   Machiavelli is the most famous political theorist to argue that, in the
--
   is morally good and wrong are the same for both public and private life
   and these domains are not governed by different moral principles, the
   public life of political servants is characterised by other duty than
   those of the individual in private life. There can even be particular
   conflicts between a person's public and private duty. Can this
   difference of duty be regarded as an effect of different forms of
   obligation?

   There is an analytical connection between duty and obligation.
   Obligation often has the same meaning as duty. To be obliged means to
   have a duty. An obligation can also be the act of obliging oneself or
   someone else. In that case, a duty is the conception of some behaviour
   as the object of an obligation. Generally, we can say that people are
   obliged to perform their duty. Determining the grounds on which this
   general obligation is founded ultimately is a difficult philosophical
   question. But is seems clear that there cannot be an obligation without
   a will imposing a duty or an obliging will. The person or entity that
   imposes an obligation is called the author and the obliged person is
   the subject of the obligation. From the point of view of their origins,
--
   the case of legal obligation, which can be enforced by an external
   authority, we are obliged by the will of another person: the lawgiver
   as the author of the obligation. To the extent that a moral duty cannot
   be enforced by an external authority, the moral necessity has the
   character of an ethical obligation. A moral duty, therefore, can be the
   object of either legal or ethical obligation.

--
   Under normal circumstances, all citizens ought to behave in conformity
   with their conscientious interpretation of the law. This obligation to
   obey can be understood as a moral duty, the explanation of which does
   not need a special conception of political obligation, as distinct from
   legal or ethical obligation. This seems true as long as the state does
   not ask of its citizens an extraordinary readiness to make sacrifices
   or to take special responsibilities. But political obligation is also
   associated with a duty to defend your country, to fight for justice
   and, particularly in war, even to risk your own life. These duty
   cannot always be seen as supererogatory, because under particular
   circumstances citizens and politicians are forced to behave in
--
   prevent the institution of a public order or make the existing legal
   system totally powerless. Under these exceptional circumstances, the
   collective duty, which only implies an ethical obligation for
   individuals, bestows a right on some individuals to take the initiative
   to impose a public order on others or, without the support of valid
--
   with the legally defined and monopolised official mode of exerting
   political power. This is not a case of ethical obligation alone because
   the duty which is the object of political obligation can in some way be
   enforced by the people, either by legal, or by particularly political
   means such as refusal, resistance, and even revolt. In a democratic
--

   Thus, political obligation seems to be a kind of obligation concerning
   the duty of political leaders and citizens together who, as a
   collectivity, are responsible for the political system as a whole. The
   domain of political obligation is situated between ethics and law. The
--
   political leader with a great sense of responsibility for national
   interests and the safety of the state will feel obliged to do things
   that go far beyond the moral duty and rights of private persons in
   daily life. Taking great responsibilities is a praiseworthy thing in
   people who have the capacities to take them. Political merit
--
   benefiting, the obligations of public offices must be clearly defined.

   Public servants have an official duty to do what the legal political
   system wants. They have this duty insofar as they themselves are a
   functional part of the system. This functional relationship is not
   characterised by what I would call a lien of political obligation,
   because its duty are defined by formal rules and legal obligation.
   The duty to perform their tasks in a formally prescribed impersonal and
   detached manner relieves civil servants of too many burdensome moral
   worries. But an excessive devotion to formal duty can also make
   officials blind to other moral requirements. Of course, corruption is
   objectionable. But our focus on corruption must not lead us to forget

   [15]duty vs responsibility duty and Responsibility are wider terms,
   which are used in a number of contexts, say in the field of law,
   management, education, ethics and so forth. These are commonly used
   with one another, but they are two different terms, wherein the duty is
   imposed on someone, to perform something which is morally, legally or
   professionally considered right. It is something which we are required
--
   accountable for or blamed for its performance and completion or
   non-completion. In this article we are going to talk about the
   difference between duty and responsibilities, have a look.

Content: duty Vs Responsibility
--
   the normal course of action in general or in specific circumstances.

   The law governing the country has specified certain duty which must
   be followed by every citizen. It exhibits an invisible force which
   binds a person to do something which is considered right in the eyes of
--
   of an individual’s position, occupation or role.

   In management, the word ‘duty’ is used to define the tasks or functions
   which an employee has to perform, as it is a part of his/her job.

   In economics, duty is described as a form of tax levied by the
   government on the goods purchased from or sold to foreign countries.
   The non-payment of such taxes may result in a penalty to the exporter
--

   The points given below are substantial so far as the difference between
   duty and responsibility is concerned:
    1. duty refers to the legal or moral obligation, or commitment towards
       certain work, which you are expected to perform, in general, or
--
    5. duty are imputed on a person, either naturally or out of the
       role/position he occupies. On the other hand, responsibility is
       nothing but demanded duty, which are shouldered on a person who
       is competent and conscientious enough to handle it.

Conclusion

   duty brings responsibility, i.e. when you say it is your duty, it
   indicates that you ought to do that because you are responsible for
   that act if it is not done properly, within the reasonable time. It
   requires allegiance on the part of the concerned individual, for the
   discharge of duty and responsibilities successfully.
