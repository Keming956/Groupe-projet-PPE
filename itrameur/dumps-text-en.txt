Participation of young people in education, employment or training

This page provides information on the law surrounding the participation of
young people (16-18 years old) in education, employment or training. This
includes the various options available to young people to ensure
participation and the duties of the Local Authority to encourage
participation.

     The law now requires all young people in England to continue in
     education or training until at least their 18th birthday.

Is education compulsory after the age of 16?

   Under previous legislation it was compulsory for young people to remain
   in education until the age of 16. However, as a result of legislation
   introduced in September 2013, the law now requires that young people
   continue in education, employment or training until the age of 18.

   Statutory guidance published by the Department of Education which
   explains the legal position can be accessed [361]here.


Why has the participation age been raised?

   This change was introduced to improve the career and life prospects for
   young people.

   There are various advantages to remaining in education or training for
   longer:
     * Young people can develop a greater range of skills
     * The likelihood of unemployment is significantly reduced
     * An increase in earning potential
     * Offers the opportunity for young people who are disengaged with
       mainstream education to develop new skills in an alternative
       setting.

What are the options available for young people?

     * Option one is to study full-time at school, college or with a
       training provider. The definition of full-time participation is at
       least 540 hours a year; this is around 18 hours per week.
     * Option two is full-time employment or volunteering (full-time is
       counted as more than 20 hours a week) combined with part-time study
       or training. To count as full-time work, the job must be for 8 or
       more weeks consecutively and for 20 or more hours per week.
       Part-time education or training alongside full-time work must be at
       least 280 hours per year.
     * Option three is to enrol in an apprenticeship, traineeship or
       supported internship.

   ([362]Section 2 Education and Skills Act 2008)

What are the duties of the Local Authority?

   The Local Authority has broad duties to encourage, enable and assist
   young people, between the ages of 16-18, to participate in education,
   employment or training.

   The legislative framework:

   [363]Sch 2, Para 4 Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act
   2009 – ‘’A Local Education Authority may secure the provision for their
   area of full-time education suitable to the requirements of persons
   over compulsory school age who have not attained the age of 19.’’

   [364]Section 10 Education and Skills Act 2008 – ‘’A Local Education
   Authority in England must ensure that its functions are (so far as they
   are capable of being so exercised) exercised so as to promote the
   effective participation in education or training of persons belonging
   to its area.’’

   [365]Section 12 Education and Skills Act 2008 – ‘’A Local Education
   Authority in England must make arrangements to enable it to establish
   (so far as it is possible to do so) the identities of persons belonging
   to its area who are not participating (in education or training.)’’
   Strategic leadership should be provided up until the time that there
   was a meeting due to take place which and therefore there are many
   strategic support organisations which govern this particular

In so far as meeting these duties, Local Authorities are expected to:

     * Provide strategic leadership in their communities to ensure that
       there is a network of support available which encourages, enables
       and assists the participation of young people in education,
       training and employment. This includes liaising with local partners
       such as employers, Jobcentre Plus, community sector organisations
       and youth offending teams.
     * Local Authorities must collect information about young people in
       their area who are not participating and to target their resources
       on those who require them most.
     * Local Authorities are expected to liase with education providers to
       identify children under the age of 16 years old who are at risk of
       not participating post-16 and for intensive support to be provided
       to remedy the situation. This is particularly important in relation
       to children with SEND who are significantly less likely to
       participate post-16 in comparison to their peers without SEND.
     * Every young person who reaches the age of 16 or 17 years old in any
       given academic year is entitled to an offer of a suitable place, by
       the end of September, to continue in education or training the
       following year. However, there is not the same duties on the Local
       Authority to offer the young person a place to continue their
       education or training; the duty is on the young person to apply to
       relevant education or training providers in order to obtain a
       place.

What are the duties of education providers?

   [366]The Education and Skills Act 2008 placed two Raising Participation
   Age related duties on education providers with regard to 16 and 17 year
   olds:
     * [367]Section 11 places a duty on education providers to promote
       good attendance to enable young people to meet their duty to
       participate.
     * [368]Section 13 places a duty on education providers to inform
       their local authority when a young person is no longer
       participating, for example, if they have dropped out.

   [369]Under Section 29  Education Act 2011, schools are under a duty to
   secure independent careers guidance for pupils in Years 8-13 on the
   full range of education and training options, including
   apprenticeships. Schools are expected to work in partnership with local
   employers and other education and training providers to ensure that
   young people have a wide range of options available to them.

Enforcement

   The legal requirement to participate is on the young person, not the
   parent/carer. Enforcement does not form part of the current law and
   therefore young people will not receive a sanction for
   non-participation. This could change in the future as this position is
   regularly reviewed.

Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty

Public Bodies’ Statutory Duty to Eliminate Discrimination, Promote Equality,
and Protect Human Rights of Staff and Service Users

   All public bodies in Ireland have responsibility to promote equality,
   prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees,
   customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies and
   plans. This is a legal obligation, called the Public Sector Equality
   and Human Rights Duty, and it originated in Section 42 of the [20]Irish
   Human Rights and Equality Act 2014.

   Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty

Implementing the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty:

   To meet the core requirements of the Duty, you must Assess, Address and
   Report.
   Public Service Duty Wheel
    1. Assess
       A public body is required to set out in its strategic/corporate
       plan an assessment of the equality and human rights issues relevant
       to its purpose and functions, in a manner that is accessible to the
       public.
    2. Address
       A public body is required to set out in its strategic/corporate
       plan the policies, plans and actions to address issues raised in
       the equality and human rights assessment, in a manner that is
       accessible to the public.
    3. Report
       A public body is required to report annually on developments and
       achievements in regard to the equality and human rights issues and
       actions, in a manner accessible to the public, in its annual
       report.

Service Users &amp; Staff

   The Duty protects the people to whom the public body provides services
   and the staff of the public body.

Strategic Planning Cycle

   The requirement to integrate the Duty in strategic plans and annual
   reports means that it is an ongoing obligation that must be monitored,
   reviewed, and developed in each strategic planning cycle.

   Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty

Section 42, Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014

   (1) A public body shall, in the performance of its functions, have
   regard to the need to—

   (a) eliminate discrimination,

   (b) promote equality of opportunity and treatment of its staff and the
   persons to whom it provides services, and

   (c) protect the human rights of its members, staff and the persons to
   whom it provides services.

   (2) For the purposes of giving effect to subsection (1), a public body
   shall, having regard to the functions and purpose of the body and to
   its size and the resources available to it—

   (a) set out in a manner that is accessible to the public in its
   strategic plan (howsoever described) an assessment of the human rights
   and equality issues it believes to be relevant to the functions and
   purpose of the body and the policies, plans and actions in place or
   proposed to be put in place to address those issues, and

   (b) report in a manner that is accessible to the public on developments
   and achievements in that regard in its annual report (howsoever
   described).

   (3) In assisting public bodies to perform their functions in a manner
   consistent with subsection (1), the Commission may give guidance to and
   encourage public bodies in developing policies of, and exercising, good
   practice and operational standards in relation to, human rights and
   equality.

   (4) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (3), the
   Commission may— (a) issue guidelines, or (b) prepare codes of practice
   in accordance with section 31, in respect of the development by public
   bodies of performance measures, operational standards and written
   preventative strategies for the purpose of reducing discrimination and
   promoting human rights and equality in the public sector workplace and
   in the provision of services to the public.

   (5) Where the Commission considers that there is evidence of a failure
   by a public body to perform its functions in a manner consistent with
   subsection (1) and that it is appropriate in all the circumstances to
   do so, the Commission may invite the public body to— (a) carry out a
   review in relation to the performance by that body of its functions
   having regard to subsection (1), or (b) prepare and implement an action
   plan in relation to the performance by that body of its functions
   having regard to subsection (1), or both.

   (6) A review or an action plan under subsection (5) may relate to— (a)
   equality of opportunity or human rights generally, or (b) a particular
   aspect of human rights or discrimination, in the public body concerned.

   (7) The Commission may, and, if requested by the Minister, shall,
   review the operation of subsection (1).

   (8) For the purposes of assisting it in carrying out a review under
   subsection (7), the Commission shall consult such persons or bodies as
   it considers appropriate.

   (9) Where the Commission carries out a review under subsection (7) it—
   (a) may, or (b) where the Minister has requested the review, shall,
   make a report of the review to the Minister and any such report shall
   include such recommendations as the Commission thinks appropriate.

   (10) The Commission shall cause a copy of the report to be laid before
   each House of the Oireachtas.

   (11) Nothing in this section shall of itself operate to confer a cause
   of action on any person against a

   public body in respect of the performance by it of its functions under
   subsection (1).

Sustainable procurement duty

   Sustainable public procurement aims to make the best use of public
   money, helping us to achieve our overarching purpose and strategic
   objectives.

   Scotland’s strong track record  of delivering sustainable procurement
   outcomes for the past 20 years, is demonstrated in our [40]Independent
   Review.

   The [41]sustainable procurement duty, outlined in Procurement Reform
   (Scotland) Act 2014, aligns with our purpose to create a more
   successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish,
   through increasing sustainable economic growth.

   It is underpinned by the [42]National Performance Framework and
   Scotland's Economic Strategy.

   The [43]sustainable procurement duty requires that before a contracting
   authority buys anything, it must think about how it can improve the
   social, environmental and economic wellbeing of the area in which it
   operates, with a particular focus on [44]reducing inequality.

   It also requires a contracting authority to consider how its
   procurement processes can [45]facilitate the involvement of SMEs, third
   sector bodies and supported businesses, and how public procurement can
   be used to promote innovation.

   The Sustainable Procurement Duty is referred to in the [46]Public
   Procurement Strategy for Scotland, and sustainable procurement is
   central to multiple of the strategic objectives. Prominent examples
   include:
     * whole life costing: the promotion of life-cycle approaches to
       establishing value for money in procurement assessment processes
     * food security: ensuring high standards of animal welfare,
       sustainable production and waste reduction through procurement
       processes to improve community health, wellbeing and education

   Compliance with the sustainable procurement duty is the mechanism
   through which public procurement contributes to and tracks its
   contribution to our overarching purpose.

   Each contracting authority must set out in its procurement strategy how
   it intends to comply with the duty, and must report annually on
   progress.

Sustainable procurement support and guidance

   Guidance has been published to help public bodies comply with the
   sustainable procurement duty and support sustainable procurement,
   including [47]statutory guidance on the sustainable procurement duty
   (chapter 3).

Sustainable procurement tools

   We have developed a range of tools to help public sector organisations
   identify and address how they can optimise the economic, social and
   environmental outcomes of their procurement activity.

   Prioritisation tool

   The prioritisation tool is designed to assist early stage strategic
   planning, and brings a standard, structured approach to the assessment
   of spend categories.

   Sustainability test

   The sustainability test is designed to help embed relevant and
   proportionate sustainability requirements in the development of
   frameworks and contracts.

   It can be used in isolation or by reference to the results of
   prioritisation assessment, where undertaken.

   Life cycle impact mapping (part of sustainability test)

   Life cycle impact mapping is used to identify and assess the social and
   environmental impacts of raw materials, manufacturing and logistics,
   use and disposal or end of life management.

   Every product and service has a 'life cycle' or number of stages it
   goes through:
     * from the extraction and sourcing of raw materials, such as mining
     * to the transportation of sub-assemblies and parts, often through a
       global supply chain
     * to the use of products or works and the delivery of services
     * to the re-use, recycling, remanufacture and final disposal of
       materials

Flexible framework assessment tool

   The flexible framework assessment tool is used to assess current level
   of performance and the actions required to embed good procurement
   practice to realise intended sustainable outcomes.

   Access the [48]sustainable procurement duty tools.

   A series of [49]sustainable procurement supporting guides are also
   available to help public sector organisations embed sustainability into
   their procurement processes.

Duty suspensions and autonomous tariff quotas

   Duty suspensions are designed to help UK and Crown Dependency
   (Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey) businesses remain competitive in
   the global marketplace. They do this by suspending import duties on
   certain goods, normally those used in domestic production.

   These suspensions do not apply to other duties that may be chargeable
   like VAT or trade remedies duty, such as anti-dumping duty.

   Duty suspensions allow unlimited quantities to be imported into the UK
   at a reduced tariff rate. Autonomous tariff quotas (ATQs) allow limited
   quantities to be imported at a reduced rate.

   Duty suspensions and ATQs are temporary and can be used by any UK
   business while in force. They are applied on a ‘Most Favoured Nation’
   (‘MFN’) basis. This means that goods subject to these suspensions or
   quotas can be imported into the UK from any country or territory at the
   specified reduced tariff rate.

   When more than one tariff concession applies, importers will wish to
   ensure that their goods are entered at the most advantageous rate.

   Read guidance on [57]declaring goods ‘not at risk’ of moving to the EU
   if you are importing goods subject to a duty suspension or an ATQ into
   Northern Ireland.

Current duty suspensions

   Find the current duty suspensions and quotas using the [58]Trade Tariff
   lookup tool.

   Duty suspensions for products which previously existed in the UK under
   the EU suspensions regime have been carried over into the UK’s
   independent regime. They have been retained, provided they came into
   force before, or as part of, the EU’s July 2020 update to ensure
   continuity for UK businesses.

   All current duty suspensions rolled over from the EU regime,
   including EU ATQs changed to duty suspensions, are extended until 31
   December 2028.

Apply for a new duty suspension

   The 2023 application window for new duty suspensions has now closed.
   The deadline for applications was 11:59pm on Sunday 6 August 2023. The
   government has received 245 applications.

   Between 20 September 2023 and 18 October 2023, the government ran a
   4-week objections window.

   The government has published a list of all products and HS commodity
   code classifications on which suspensions are being considered as a
   result of this year’s application process. The wider public were
   invited to submit any objections they had on the proposed suspensions.

   The objections window has now closed, but the list is still accessible
   below.
     * [59]Notice of UK duty suspensions: 2023 application window (ODS,
       28.0 KB)

   The list is not an indication of whether an application has been
   successful. The government expects to confirm the outcome of all
   applications in early 2024.

   The government is currently considering objections that have been
   received as part of an assessment process. Whilst individual objections
   will not be publicly disclosed, the government may reach out to
   applicants if any further clarification of, or information related to,
   their application is required.

   An objection to an application does not automatically lead to a
   rejection of that application. All objections are being considered
   alongside all other information, where the government is taking into
   account the core criteria and any other relevant considerations.

   The criteria and examples of the wider considerations the government
   will consider when assessing applications are set out below.

   Continue to monitor this page for updates or [60]subscribe to get
   emails alerts for this page.

How we will assess applications in 2023

   Applications submitted as part of this process need to meet both of the
   following criteria:
     * the product you are seeking a suspension on should not be not
       traded between persons who are related parties (defined in
       [61]Regulation 8(4) of the Customs Tariff (Suspension of Import
       Duty Rates) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020) in circumstances which
       would not enable other United Kingdom businesses to benefit from
       the suspension
     * the same product (falling under the same commodity code) or similar
       products, should not be produced in the UK or Crown Dependencies,
       not produced in sufficient quantities, or production should be
       temporarily insufficient. (Products other than raw products are
       taken to be produced in the UK or a Crown Dependency if they are
       partly or wholly manufactured in the UK or a Crown Dependency.
       Simple assembly operations, repacking products, or preparing
       products for shipment or transportation would not normally be
       considered production processes)

   We strongly recommend you ensure your application meets these criteria.
   If these criteria are not met, your application may not be considered.

   Tariff suspensions are designed to help UK and Crown Dependency
   businesses remain competitive in the global marketplace. They do this
   by suspending, either in whole or in part, UK Global Tariff import
   duties on certain goods, normally those used as inputs into domestic
   production processes.

   When assessing applications, the government will also take into account
   relevant considerations. These may include:
     * international arrangements to which the UK is a party (for example
       free trade agreements)
     * factors such as:
          + the interests of consumers in the United Kingdom
          + the interests of producers in the United Kingdom of the goods
            concerned
          + the desirability of maintaining and promoting the external
            trade of the United Kingdom
          + the desirability of maintaining and promoting productivity in
            the United Kingdom
          + the extent to which the goods concerned are subject to
            competition
     * how other government policies may be affected by the proposed duty
       suspension (such as trade remedies)
     * any circumvention risks due to tariff reclassification

Outcome of the 2021 duty suspension window

   The government invited applications for duty suspensions between 1 June
   and 31 July 2021. As a result, over 100 measures were implemented on 1
   January 2023.

       application window (ODT, 55.1 KB)

Coronavirus (COVID-19) critical products

   The UK government implemented tariff suspensions on a number of medical
   items critical in the response to COVID-19 on 1 January 2021. The
   government has extended the suspension of import duties for the
   majority of these products until 31 December 2023. Three suspensions
   were expired for goods where there have been no imports under the
   suspensions (5603 91 10, 2905 44 11 00 and 2905 44 99 00). This was
   based on HMRC raw customs data for the period January 2021 to August
   2022.

   In an effort to provide continuity for businesses and ease pressures on
   the NHS, these suspensions are now extended until 31 December 2028.

Sunflower-seed oil

   The UK government will implement a tariff suspension on sunflower-seed
   oil on 1 January 2023 in response to supply chain disruption. This
   measure will take effect until 31 December 2024.

Current ATQs

   The UK currently has 6 existing ATQs:
     * 5 ATQs for fish products
     * 1 ATQ for raw cane sugar

   Read more detail on these products:
     * [64]List of autonomous tariff quotas (ODT, 29.6 KB)

ATQs for fish products

   4 ATQs  for fish products will continue at current volume levels until
   31 December 2024. These will be reviewed ahead of that date.

   ATQ order number 05.2794 is set at 6,500 tonnes for 2023.

ATQ for raw cane sugar

   The UK implemented an ATQ on raw cane sugar on 1 January 2021 following
   its departure from the EU. Following a subsequent review of all UK ATQs
   in 2021, we maintained the volume level of this ATQ at 260,000 tonnes.

   In the context of recent domestic supply challenges and significant
   increases in sugar prices, we reached out to a range of stakeholders in
   Autumn 2023 and welcomed information from any interested stakeholders
   via contact details provided on gov.uk. We wanted to understand any
   issues in the UK sugar market and to consider potential mitigations
   that the Government could take in 2023.

   We received eight responses in total, providing information from a
   range of stakeholders who we know have an interest in this area,
   including representatives from the industry and from those representing
   consumer and retail interests.

   Whilst the responses received reflected the different interests of
   stakeholders, there were some common themes. These are summarised
   below:
     * The relatively poor UK and European sugar beet harvests in 2022 led
       to increased imports of raw cane sugar in 2023.  Currently, the
       harvest outlook for the 2023 to 2024 season is more positive.
     * World sugar prices are high which is pushing up prices in the UK
       and the EU. The relatively smaller 2022 harvest in the UK and the
       EU, which has resulted in higher-than-normal imports to meet
       demand, has caused the European price to rise even above the world
       price level. Some stakeholders also noted the impact of tariff
       policy on prices.

   Overall, there were varying views on the proposed Government options
   for action in this area in 2023. There was no consensus on the
   preferred approach. Some stakeholders were in favour of providing
   greater access for tariff-free sources of sugar, and some were in
   favour of an uplift to the ATQ. Some were in favour of both. Others
   were opposed to any change and cited concerns about the impact on
   domestic production, other producers (for example, in developing
   countries) or standards. There was also no consensus on the impact any
   such change would have on consumer prices.

   In coming to a decision, the Government took into account the
   stakeholder views received as part of this process. We also drew on our
   internal analysis including consideration of a range of factors,
   including potential impacts on consumers, producers and the UK’s wider
   strategic trade objectives.

   On the basis of these considerations, the Government has decided to
   maintain the current sugar ATQ for 2023 at the existing level of
   260,000 tonnes for the remainder of 2023.

Overview

   Conveyance duty, commonly known as stamp duty, is a tax you pay when
   you buy property in the ACT, whether it’s a home, land, or a commercial
   property.

   The Government is continuing to reduce conveyance duty rates for
   residential properties.

   Since 1 July 2021, eligible owner-occupiers of residential properties
   have paid a reduced rate of conveyance duty. On or after 1 July 2023,
   duty on owner-occupier purchases up to $260,000 will be at the lower
   rate of 0.49%.

   From 1 July 2023, commercial properties with a dutiable value of
   $1,800,000 or less will pay no conveyance duty. Where the value is
   greater than $1,800,000 a flat rate of 5 per cent will apply.

Calculating your duty

   The amount of duty you pay depends on the property’s purchase price or
   market value (being the greater of).
     * If you buy a property that already has a building on it, you
       pay duty on the combined value of the house and the land. This
       includes a home purchased under the land rent scheme.
     * If you buy a block of land that doesn’t have a house on it, but the
       seller is building one on the land before you settle as part of
       your contract, you still pay duty on the combined value of the
       house and the land. Examples include house-and-land packages and
       off-the-plan property purchases.

   If you buy land under one contract and arrange to build a house on the
   land under a separate contract, you pay duty on the land contract only.
   This also includes land under the land rent scheme.

   Duty rates and thresholds depend on the date of your transaction. The
   transaction date is the date of the grant, transfer or agreement for
   transfer – whichever comes first. It’s not the settlement date.

   Use our calculator below to get an estimate of the duty you will pay.

Getting assistance

   If you’re buying a home, land or both, you may be eligible for a stamp
   duty concession through one of the following:
     * [13]Home Buyer Concession Scheme,
     * [14]Pensioner Duty Concession Scheme,
     * [15]Disability Duty Concession Scheme.

   Under certain circumstances, you may also be eligible to [16]defer your
   duty payment or be eligible for an [17]exemption.

   Once you determine your eligibility you can claim it on the forms you
   lodge at Access Canberra. If we need to see your supporting documents,
   we’ll contact you after the transaction is finished.

Proof of identity

   Access Canberra requires you provide proof of your identity through a
   [18]Buyer Verification Declaration before you lodge the transfer. All
   identification must be valid and current.

   Individuals (including individuals as trustees) must provide details
   from two different identification documents: primary and secondary.
   Foreign citizens holding a visa must supply visa details.

   Companies and corporate trustees must provide an ABN.

Primary identification

     * Australian or overseas birth certificate
     * Australian or overseas passport
     * Australian citizenship certificate
     * [19]ImmiCard

Secondary identification

     * Australian or overseas birth certificate
     * Australian or overseas passport
     * Australian citizenship certificate
     * [20]ImmiCard
     * Australian driver licence
     * Medicare card
     * Australian visa

Paying duty

   Duty is payable 14 days after when the title to your property is
   registered at Access Canberra (the end of the transaction), rather than
   when you exchange contracts (the beginning of the transaction).

   After the settlement date of your contract, you have (and your agent
   has) 14 days to lodge your transfer instrument for title registration
   with Access Canberra. Penalty tax may be applied if the transfer is
   lodged late.

   Remember you will need to complete the [21]Buyer Verification
   Declaration before you lodge the transfer instrument at Access
   Canberra. Don’t forget to claim your owner-occupier rate, concession or
   exemption, if you’re eligible, by entering the [22]concession code
   number on the Buyer Verification Declaration before you lodge for
   registration.

   Once Access Canberra accepts and registers your title, we’ll email a
   Notice of Assessment to you* and your agent, if applicable. The Notice
   of Assessment will state:
     * the parties to the transaction
     * details of the transaction
     * how much duty you must pay
     * payment options
     * your unique payment reference number.

   *If there are two or more taxpayers, we’ll email the notice to the
   person whose name appears first on the transfer (that is, to the
   contact address listed on the Buyer Verification Declaration).

   If you’ve claimed an owner occupier rate, concession or exemption, it
   will show up on the notice as a reduced amount of duty. You’ll be
   advised of your ongoing eligibility requirements if it’s relevant (e.g.
   residency requirements).

   Payment must be made in 14 days and can be made by BPAY or Electronic
   Funds Transfer. [23]Interest applies to late payments. As conveyance
   duty is a known cost of purchasing a property, the Revenue Office
   expects payments to be made on time and does not provide payments plans
   for conveyance duty.

   You’ll need to keep all records of the transaction for at least five
   years after settlement, in case we request copies. Be sure that all the
   details on your transfer and other documentation are true and correct;
   giving false or misleading information is a serious offence. If you’ve
   underpaid duty, we may impose interest or penalty tax.

Transactions before 18 September 2017

   Different rules apply to transactions where you signed the contract
   before 18 September 2017. See the [24]Transactions before 18 September
   2017 page for more information.

    2. Buying goods online coming from a non-European Union country

Buying goods online coming from a non-European Union country

   Page contents
   (BUTTON)

   In recent years, the ease of ordering online from our own homes has
   made e-commerce one of the most popular ways for EU consumers to
   purchase goods. When you buy goods online that are already located in
   the EU at the time of sale, there are no customs formalities and
   Value-Added Tax (VAT) is already included in the final price you pay at
   checkout. However, consumers should be aware that ordering goods online
   that are located outside the EU at the time of sale, will result in a
   customs declaration being made and may result in customs duties and
   handling fees being incurred. Furthermore, import VAT may be charged to
   the consumer on delivery if the seller of the goods has not already
   charged VAT on the product and remitted it via the [78]EU Import One
   Stop Shop.

Ordering goods online that are dispatched from a non-EU country

   When you buy a product from a non-EU country, VAT is payable on your
   purchase irrespective of the value of the goods. In addition to VAT,
   you may also have to pay customs duties for goods above €150 and excise
   duty for specific goods. If the terms of sale do not specify another
   arrangement, the goods can be held by the customs authority at entry,
   pending the payment of duty and tax, amongst other reasons (if the
   goods are prohibited in the EU, for example).

Possible charges on import

Import VAT

   When you buy online from a non-EU country, VAT must also be paid, just
   as if you ordered goods that are already located within the EU. The VAT
   is either paid at the point of purchase on the website (for example,
   when you buy from a seller who is registered to use the Import One Stop
   Shop for VAT), or the postal operator or courier may collect the VAT
   from you on delivery.

   Information on the VAT, customs duties and other charges due should be
   clearly explained on the website, and if they cannot be calculated in
   advance, you must be informed that additional charges may be payable.
   Ask assistance from the website to estimate how much more money you
   will have to pay and compare the price with other offers. In general,
   traders from non-EU countries selling to consumers in the EU must
   comply with EU law, including [79]EU consumer law.

   One easy way to check if VAT has been included in the price or not is
   to check whether the website is signed up to the EU Import One Stop
   Shop for VAT. If they are, VAT will already have been included in the
   price you have paid at the moment of purchase. Most of the biggest
   online platforms have signed up to the Import One Stop Shop.

Customs clearance fees

   Customs clearance for release for free circulation is the documented
   permission granted by the national customs authority in the EU to allow
   the goods to be used or consumed in the EU. This permission is given to
   the person that declared the goods to customs. For e-commerce goods, it
   is typically a shipping agent (postal operator or courier) that will
   charge you a customs clearance fee for complying with the necessary
   formalities.  The permission is proof that all applicable customs
   formalities have been completed, including the payment of duties, and
   the shipment is free to be used or consumed.

   These charges can vary from company to company. An overview of charges
   applied by Universal Service Providers for postal services in the EU as
   of June 2022 is available [80]here.

   Goods for which you do not have to pay customs duties (e.g. with total
   value lower than €150) are also subject to customs clearance.

   Customs officers examine packages arriving from outside the EU in order
   to:
     * control goods that are not allowed or restricted in the EU
     * confirm that the description and value stated on the customs
       declaration is correct and
     * check the Customs Declaration to determine if customs duty, excise
       duty and/or Import VAT are chargeable.

Excise duties

   Depending on the goods you order, you may receive an invoice for excise
   duties from the customs authorities, your postal operator or the
   courier. This invoice must be paid before the goods are handed over to
   you.

   See [81]how excise duties are  calculated in the EU Member States.

Warning

   Some commercial websites may offer to show a value on the customs
   declaration that is much lower than the actual price paid so that you
   don't have to pay duty and/or pay lower VAT. This may also result in
   seizure of the goods and/or additional costs and possible a fine at
   delivery.

VAT in detail

   Import VAT is calculated as a percentage (VAT rate) of the taxable
   amount. The VAT rate is the one applicable in the country where the
   goods are being delivered. You can check the [82]VAT rates applied on
   various goods in each country through the [83]Taxes in Europe database.

   The VAT taxable amount is made up of the customs value plus taxes,
   duties, levies and other charges, such as shipping and insurance costs.
   Remember: the import VAT may either be included in the overall delivery
   price or not.

   If the import VAT is not included in the price paid to the seller, you
   will have to pay it to the postal company or express courier, or
   directly to the customs if you clear the goods at customs yourself. In
   the latter case, the procedure differs according to the country of
   import.

   If you pay “all inclusive”, you will be paying import VAT to the seller
   when paying the total price at the moment of purchase. But if the
   import VAT is not properly estimated by the seller, or if the seller
   fails to ensure the transfer of this VAT amount to the tax authority,
   national legislation can hold you jointly liable.

     You should check with your national tax administration ([84]national
     links/websites, which has competence in this matter.

Customs duty in detail

   On the basis of the data provided in the customs declaration, the
   supporting documents that accompany it and any information which they
   may request, the competent customs officers determine, impose and
   collect Customs duties that are due.

   Customs duty is typically calculated as a percentage of the customs
   value of the goods:

   The percentage or rate varies depending on the type of goods. You can
   check the tariff applicable in the [85]TARIC database.

   The customs value is based on the price paid for the goods.

   Customs duty is not due for goods, provided directly to the buyer when
   their value does not exceed €150, excluding transport and insurance
   costs. This relief does not apply to perfumes and toilet waters,
   tobacco or tobacco products and alcoholic products which are subject to
   special duty-free limits on the quantity provided.

   In some cases, additional duties may be charged, depending on the
   country of manufacture of the goods. The [86]TARIC database covers all
   measures relating to tariff, commercial and agricultural legislation.

The customs declaration in detail

   The customs declaration provides information to the customs authorities
   about the goods that you are importing. This declaration must be
   submitted by a person established in the EU or their representative who
   is able to present the goods to customs. This person is typically the
   buyer (i.e. the importer) that ordered the goods..

   If you are the person who submits the customs declaration, a courier
   company may offer to make the declaration on your behalf, but there is
   normally a charge for this service. If you are not the person who
   submits the customs declaration, you should verify with the supplier
   that it is submitted. The customs declaration should indicate correctly
   the nature of the goods and their value not taking into account taxes,
   charges, transport or other additional costs.

   It is in the customer's own interest to make sure that the declaration
   has been submitted and is accurate. If no declaration is made, or the
   information in it was found to be inaccurate, the acceptance of the
   declaration, and thus the delivery of the package to you may be delayed
   or even not take place as the customs officials are entitled to make
   further enquiries and impose penalties and sanctions.

   The customs authority carrying out the customs clearance is entitled to
   open and examine any package if it considers this appropriate. Packages
   might even be seized by customs and, when appropriate, destroyed.

Excise duty in detail

   Excise duties are indirect taxes on the sale or use of specific
   products, such as alcohol and tobacco, and are payable on these goods
   on entry into the EU. EU legislation sets out only minimum levels of
   excise duty above which individual Member States are free to set their
   own rates. You can check the [87]excise duty rates applied on the goods
   concerned through the [88]Taxes in Europe database. Besides the list of
   excise products at EU level, Member States have national lists of
   excise products with their own excise rates, which may vary from one
   Member State to another. The goods will be held by the Customs
   Authority at entry into your country, pending the payment of excise
   duty.

     You should check with your national tax administration ([89]national
     links/websites), which has the competence in this matter.

   EU rules regulating customs, VAT and excise apply or do not apply,

Excise duties on alcohol, tobacco and energy

   Excise duties are indirect taxes on the sale or use of specific
   products, such as alcohol, tobacco and energy. The revenue from these
   excise duties goes entirely to the country to which they are paid.

   EU countries agreed on common EU rules to make sure that excise duties
   are applied in the same way and to the same products everywhere in the
   Union.

   This helps prevent trade distortions in the Single Market, ensures fair
   competition between businesses, and reduces administrative burdens for
   companies.

   In addition, EU law sets out [79]common provisions, which apply to all
   products subject to excise duties. These common provisions include the
   framework for the [80]Excise Monitoring and Control System (EMCS), an
   IT system for monitoring the movement of excise goods within the EU.

Active Duty Retirement

   Members who accumulate 20 or more years of active service are eligible
   for retirement. There are three non-disability retirement plans
   currently in effect for active duty retirees. These are Final Pay plan,
   High-36 Month Average plan, and Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986
   (more commonly referred to as REDUX) plan.

   The basic retirement formula is:

   Retired Pay Base X Multiplier %

Final Pay Plan

   The Final Pay plan uses the Final Pay method to determine the retired
   pay base. See the [57]Retirement page.

   The Final Pay plan uses a multiplier % that is 2.5% times the years of
   creditable service. The years of creditable service for an active duty
   retirement calculation is the sum of years of active service (i.e.,
   active duty or full-time National Guard duty) and any additional years
   computed by adding all reserve points, if any (except those for active
   service)and dividing by 360.

High-36 Plan

   The High-36 retirement plan uses the High-36 method to determine the
   retired pay base. See the [58]Retirement page.

   The High-36 retirement plan uses a multiplier % that is the same as the
   final pay plan.

REDUX Plan

   The REDUX retirement plan is an option available only to active duty
   members who entered service on or after August 1, 1986. It includes a
   $30,000 Career Status Bonus (CSB).

   The REDUX retirement plan uses the High-36 method to determine the
   retired pay base. See the [59]Retirement page.

   The REDUX retirement plan uses a multiplier that is the same as for the
   High-36 retirement plan, except the multiplier is reduced by one
   percentage point for each year less than 30 the member has at
   retirement.

Years of Service

   The years of creditable service for computation of the retired pay
   percentage multiplier include all active duty and any credited reserve
   points divided by 360.

Tax and duty

   You’ll be contacted by Royal Mail, Parcelforce or the courier company
   if you need to pay any VAT, duty or delivery charges (‘handling fees’)
   to receive your goods.

   They’ll send you a bill stating exactly which fees you need to pay.

   They’ll normally hold your parcel for about 3 weeks. If you have not
   paid the bill by then, your parcel will be returned to the sender.

   You will not have to pay anything to the delivery company to receive
   goods worth less than £135 unless they’re gifts over £39 or excise
   goods (for example, alcohol and tobacco).

VAT

   VAT is charged on all goods (except for gifts worth £39 or less) sent
   from:
     * outside the UK to Great Britain
     * outside the UK and the EU to Northern Ireland

   VAT is not charged on [43]goods that are gifts worth £39 or less.

   You pay VAT when you buy the goods or to the delivery company before
   you receive them. If you have to pay VAT to the delivery company, it’s
   charged on the total package value, including:
     * the value of the goods
     * postage, packaging and insurance
     * any duty you owe

   VAT is charged at the [44]VAT rate that applies to your goods.

Goods worth £135 or less in total

   If you bought the goods yourself and they are not excise goods, the
   seller will have included VAT in the total you paid.

   You will need to pay VAT to the delivery company if the goods are:
     * gifts sent to you by someone else and worth more than £39
     * excise goods

Goods worth more than £135 in total

   You will have to pay VAT to the delivery company either before the
   goods are delivered or when you collect them.

Customs Duty

   You’ll be charged Customs Duty on all goods sent from outside the UK
   (or the UK and the EU if you’re in Northern Ireland) if they’re either:
     * excise goods
     * worth more than £135

   If you’re charged Customs Duty, you’ll need to pay it on both:
     * the price paid for the goods
     * postage, packaging and insurance

   Type and value of goods Customs Duty
   Non-excise goods worth £135 or less No charge
   Gifts and goods above £135 The rate depends on the type of goods and
   where they came from - [45]call the helpline

   You pay Customs Duty on excise goods of any value.

Excise Duty

   If you’re sent alcohol or tobacco from outside the UK, you’ll be
   charged Excise Duty at [46]current rates.

   If the goods are sent from the EU to Northern Ireland, check that the
   Excise Duty was included in the price. If it’s not, [47]your goods may
   be seized.

   It does not matter whether you buy the goods or they’re sent as a gift.

   If you receive large amounts of alcohol or tobacco for your business,
   use the [48]Trade Tariff to check duty rates.

   Your goods can also be seized if they’re:
     * spirits over 35 centilitres without a UK duty stamp
     * cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco without UK health warnings or
       fiscal marks

If you’re charged too much or return your goods

   Ask for a refund of VAT or Customs Duty if you:
     * return your goods
     * think you’ve been charged too much

   Download and fill in:
     * [49]form BOR 286 if Royal Mail or Parcelforce delivered the goods
     * [50]form C285 if a courier or freight company delivered the goods

Details

   The aim of Prevent is to stop people from becoming terrorists or
   supporting terrorism.

   The objectives of Prevent are to:
     * tackle the ideological causes of terrorism
     * intervene early to support people susceptible to radicalisation
     * enable people who have already engaged in terrorism to disengage
       and rehabilitate

   This is statutory guidance for England and Wales, issued on 7 September
   2023 under [46]Section 29 of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act
   2015. Subject to Parliamentary approval, it comes into force on 31
   December 2023.

   There is separate [47]guidance for Scotland.

   This statutory guidance is intended for use by:
     * senior leadership teams in any of the specified authorities listed
       in Part 1 of Schedule 6 of the CTSA 2015
     * those with dedicated Prevent and/or safeguarding responsibilities
     * people in specified authorities with responsibility for how
       resources and funding are used, and for external partnerships
     * those in a frontline role and likely to engage with people who may
       be susceptible to radicalisation

   This guidance may also inform best practice for other sectors that are
   not specified authorities but may wish to consider how to prevent the
   risk of people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism.

   The list of specified authorities subject to the duty at section 26
   CTSA 2015 can be found at Part 1 of [48]Schedule 6 of the CTSA 2015.
   Further details are in the sector specific sections of this guidance.

   This guidance replaces the:
     * Revised Prevent duty guidance: for England and Wales (2015)
     * Prevent duty guidance: for further education institutions in
       England and Wales (2015)
     * Prevent duty guidance: for higher education institutions in England
       and Wales 2015 (updated in April 2021)

   Specified authorities in England and Wales must continue to have regard
   to the [49]2015 guidance until the new guidance comes into force.

   A [50]glossary of terms used in the Prevent duty guidance.

   We are aware that some of these publications may have accessibility
   issues. We are reviewing it so that we can fix these.

Tax when you buy shares

   [39]Skip to contents of guide

Contents

    1. Overview
    2. [40]Buying shares electronically
    3. [41]Buying shares using a stock transfer form
    4. [42]Special share arrangements

Overview

   When you buy shares, you usually pay a tax or duty of 0.5% on the
   transaction.

   If you buy:
     * shares [43]electronically, you’ll pay Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT)
     * shares [44]using a stock transfer form, you’ll pay Stamp Duty if
       the transaction is over £1,000

   You’ll have to pay tax at 1.5% if you transfer shares into some
   [45]‘depositary receipt schemes’ or ‘clearance services’.

   You pay tax on the price you pay for the shares, even if their actual
   market value is much higher.

Transactions you pay tax on

   You pay tax when you buy:
     * existing shares in a company incorporated in the UK
     * an option to buy shares
     * an interest in shares, for example an interest in the money from
       selling them
     * shares in a foreign company that has a share register in the UK
     * rights arising from shares, for example rights you have when new
       shares are issued

When you do not pay tax

   You do not have to pay tax if you:
     * are given shares for nothing
     * subscribe to a new issue of shares in a company
     * buy shares in an ‘open ended investment company’ (OEIC) from the
       fund manager
     * buy units in a unit trust from the fund manager

   You do not normally have to pay Stamp Duty or SDRT if you buy foreign
   shares outside the UK. But you may have to pay [46]other taxes.

When you sell the shares

   You may need to pay [47]Capital Gains Tax when you sell your shares.

Help and advice

   [48]Contact Stamp Duty share enquiries for general information about
   Stamp Duty on shares.

   [49]Contact Stamp Duty Reserve Tax enquiries if you have questions
   about Stamp Duty on electronic paperless share transactions.

   You can also [50]get professional help (for example, from a tax
   adviser) with your tax.

   Organizational responsibility:
   [77]duty to accommodate

Page content

   Under the Code, employers and unions, housing providers and service
   providers have a legal duty to accommodate the needs of people with
   disabilities who are adversely affected by a requirement, rule or
   standard. Accommodation is necessary to ensure that people with
   disabilities have equal opportunities, access and benefits. Employment,
   housing, services and facilities should be designed inclusively and
   must be adapted to accommodate the needs of a person with a disability
   in a way that promotes integration and full participation.

   In the context of employment, the Supreme Court of Canada has described
   the goals and purposes of accommodation:

     ... the goal of accommodation is to ensure that an employee who is
     able to work can do so. In practice, this means that the employer
     must accommodate the employee in a way that, while not causing the
     employer undue hardship, will ensure that the employee can work. The
     purpose of the duty to accommodate is to ensure that persons who are
     otherwise fit to work are not unfairly excluded where working
     conditions can be adjusted without undue hardship.

                                     …

     The test is not whether it was impossible for the employer to
     accommodate the employee's characteristics. The employer does not
     have a duty to change working conditions in a fundamental way, but
     does have a duty, if it can do so without undue hardship, to arrange
     the employee's workplace or duties to enable the employee to do his
     or her work.^[78][120]

   Requirements under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with
   Disabilities provide that States Parties, including Canada, must take
   steps to make sure that people with disabilities are provided with
   accommodation (for example, to ensure equal access to justice,
   education and employment).^[79][121]

   The duty to accommodate has both a substantive and a procedural
   component. The procedure to assess an accommodation (the process) is as
   important as the substantive content of the accommodation (the
   accommodation provided).^[80][122] In a case involving the
   accommodation of a mental health disability in the workplace, the court
   said: “a failure to give any thought or consideration to the issue of
   accommodation, including what, if any, steps could be taken constitutes
   a failure to satisfy the ‘procedural’ duty to accommodate.”^[81][123]

   In Ontario, it is clear that a failure in the procedural duty to
   accommodate can lead to a finding of a breach of the Code even if there
   was no substantive accommodation that could have been provided short of
   undue hardship. Failure to perform either component of the duty is a
   failure to carry out the duty to accommodate.^[82][124]

   Moreover, an organization will not be able to argue persuasively that
   providing accommodation would cause undue hardship if it has not taken
   steps to explore accommodation solutions, and otherwise fulfil the
   procedural component of the duty to accommodate.^[83][125]

     Example: In one case, a human rights tribunal upheld a claim of
     discrimination against a housing co-op when it failed to investigate
     what was required to accommodate a woman and her children who were
     experiencing asthma due to mould allergies in their apartment unit.
     Instead of accepting that the woman had a legitimate problem, the
     co-op was adversarial and treated her as if she was a “loony tune.”
     The co-op also did not respond to her legitimate request to be moved
     to another unit. Instead, it chose not to communicate with her after
     it suggested that her family move out, except to send a threatening
     letter from the co-op’s lawyers.^[84][126]

8.1 Principles of accommodation

   The duty to accommodate is informed by three principles: respect for
   dignity, individualization, as well as integration and full
   participation.

8.1.1 Respect for dignity

   The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states
   “…discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a
   violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human
   person.”^[85][127]

   The duty to accommodate people with disabilities means accommodation
   must be provided in the way that most respects the dignity of the
   person, if doing so does not cause undue hardship. Human dignity
   encompasses individual self-respect, self-worth and inherent worth as a
   human being. It includes physical and psychological integrity and
   empowerment. It is harmed when people are marginalized, stigmatized,
   ignored or devalued. Privacy, confidentiality, comfort, individuality
   and self-esteem are all important factors.

   Respect and support for a person’s autonomy is also crucial. It
   reflects a person’s right to self-determination, to be treated without
   paternalism, and means subjecting people to minimal interference in
   their choices. Consideration needs to be given to how accommodation is
   provided and the person’s own participation in the process.

   Respect for dignity includes being considered as a whole person, not
   merely in relation to one’s disability. It includes respecting and
   valuing the perspectives of people with disabilities, particularly when
   people speak about their own experiences.

   Housing providers, service providers and employers should consider
   different ways of accommodating people with disabilities along a
   continuum, ranging from ways that most respect dignity and other human
   rights values, to those that least respect those values.

     Example: An accommodation that shows little respect for the dignity
     of a person with a disability is an accessible entrance over a
     loading dock or through a service area or garbage room. People who
     use mobility devices should have the same opportunity as others to
     enter a building in a pleasant and convenient manner.

8.1.2 Individualization

   There is no set formula for accommodating people identified
   by Code grounds. Each person’s needs are unique and must be considered
   afresh when an accommodation request is made. People sharing the same
   condition often experience it in very different ways, with different
   symptoms, limitations and prognoses. In terms of accommodation, what
   might work for one person may not work for another.^[86][128]

     Example: The Supreme Court of Canada found that a workplace
     attendance standard that defined a maximum period for employee
     absences was prima facie discriminatory in part because it did not
     take into account the individualized nature of the accommodation
     process.[87]^^[129]

   Accommodations may need to be re-visited over time to make sure that
   they continue to meet a person’s needs appropriately.

8.1.3 Integration and full participation

   Accommodations should be developed and implemented with a view to
   maximizing a person’s integration and full participation. Achieving
   integration and full participation requires barrier-free and inclusive
   design, as well as removing existing barriers. Where barriers continue
   to exist because it is impossible to remove them at a given point in
   time, then accommodations should be provided, up to the point of undue
   hardship.

     Example: A children’s swimming program at a community centre assigns
     an additional instructor to a class that includes a boy who has
     autism, at his parents’ request. This allows the boy to get the
     extra support he needs to access the service within the regular
     program.

   Employment, housing, services and facilities should be built, and must
   be adapted, to accommodate the needs of a person with a disability in a
   way that promotes their integration and full participation.

   It is well-established in human rights law that equality may sometimes
   require different treatment that does not offend the person’s dignity.
   In some circumstances, the best way to ensure the equality of people
   with disabilities may be to provide separate or specialized services.
   However, it should be kept in mind that segregated treatment in
   services, employment or housing for people with disabilities is less
   dignified and is unacceptable, unless it can be shown that integrated
   treatment would pose undue hardship or that segregation is the only way
   to achieve equality.[88]^^[130]

8.2 Inclusive design

   Ensuring integration and full participation means designing society and
   structures for inclusiveness. Inclusive or “universal”
   design^[89][131] emphasizes barrier-free environments and equal
   participation of persons with disabilities with varying levels of
   ability. It is a preferred approach to removing barriers or making
   “one-off” accommodations, which assume that existing structures may
   only need slight modifications to make them acceptable.

   The right to equality can be breached by a failure to address the needs
   of disadvantaged groups. As the Supreme Court of Canada has observed:

     [T]he principle that discrimination can accrue from a failure to
     take positive steps to ensure that disadvantaged groups benefit
     equally from services offered to the general public is widely
     accepted in the human rights field^.[90][132]

   Effective inclusive design will minimize the need for people to ask for
   individualized accommodation. As the Law Commission of Ontario has
   said:

     The concept of universal design, which requires those who develop or
     provide laws, policies, programs or services to take into account
     diversity from the outset, is connected to the principle of autonomy
     and independence in that, when properly implemented, universal
     design removes from persons with disabilities the burden of
     navigating onerous accommodation processes and negotiating the
     accommodations and supports that they need in order to live
     autonomously and independently. In this way, the principle of
     autonomy and independence is closely linked to that of participation
     and inclusion.”[91]^^[133]

   The Supreme Court has noted the need to “fine-tune” society so that
   structures and assumptions do not exclude persons with disabilities
   from taking part in society.[92]^^[134] It has affirmed that standards
   should be designed to reflect all members of society, to the extent
   that this is reasonably possible.[93]^^[135] Housing providers, service
   providers, employers and others need to build in conceptions of
   equality to standards or requirements.[94]^^[136] This proactive
   approach is more effective because it emphasizes accessibility and
   inclusion from the start.

   Organizations, including government, should use the principles of
   inclusive design when they are developing and building policies,
   programs, procedures, standards, requirements and facilities.

     Example: A municipal community centre installs visual fire alarms in
     all of its buildings to ensure that people who are deaf, deafened or
     hard of hearing are able to identify emergency situations.

     Example: Voters and candidates with disabilities have the right to
     accommodation during elections.^[95][137] Leading up to a provincial
     by-election, the election office procures only accessible facilities
     for polling stations.^[96][138] Accessibility
     standards^[97][139] are specified in facility rental agreements and
     accessible voting equipment and services are available so that
     people with disabilities can vote independently on election day.
     Local riding associations follow similar accessibility standards
     when selecting locations for all-candidate debates and all parties
     agree to share the costs of sign language interpreters and
     captioning to make sure voters and candidates with hearing
     disabilities can participate equally.^[98][140]

   New barriers should never be created when designing new structures or
   revising old ones.^[99][141] Organizations that knowingly create new
   barriers for people with disabilities, or take steps that perpetuate
   existing barriers, may violate the Code. Design plans should
   incorporate current accessibility standards such as the Principles of
   Universal Design.[100]^^[142] This type of planning decreases the need
   to remove barriers and provide accommodations at a later date.

     Example: The entrance to a convenience store included four steps up
     to the front door, the store’s only public entrance. As a result,
     people who use wheelchairs, scooters, strollers and people who have
     other types of mobility disabilities could not access the store.
     Despite a major renovation to the building that included significant
     changes to its store-front, the owner neglected to install a ramp or
     an automatic door-opener to make the premises physically accessible
     to everyone.

     Example: A television production company implements a scent-free
     policy throughout its workplace. Wherever possible, it avoids the
     use of chemical agents and makes conscious efforts to seek out less
     toxic materials in its business operations. It conducts training on
     environmental sensitivities for its managers and staff, and informs
     its clients about its policy.

   The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities
   Act[101]^^[143] provides a mechanism for developing, implementing and
   enforcing accessibility standards with the goal of a fully accessible
   province by 2025. Standards have already been passed into regulation
   for customer service, employment, information and communication,
   transportation and public spaces. Changes have also been made to the
   accessibility provisions of the Building Code
   Regulation.^[102][144] Under the AODA, government public and private
   sector employers, service providers and landlords are required to
   comply with accessibility standards in varying degrees over time
   relative to an organization’s size and sector. If accessibility
   standards under the AODA fall short of requirements under the Code in a
   given situation, the requirements of the Code will prevail.^[103][145]

   Along with the expectation to prevent barriers at the design stage
   through inclusive design, organizations should be aware of systemic
   barriers in systems and structures that already exist. They should
   actively identify and seek to remove these existing barriers.

     Example: A school board reviews its website to identify possible
     barriers for people with disabilities. It unlocks several design
     elements so that people with low vision can increase the font size
     on their desktops and “pinch" or zoom in closer on their mobile
     devices. It adds descriptive text tags to logos and images for users
     with very limited or no vision. It also modifies the presentation of
     the website’s content to ensure high colour contrast and clear
     “focus order.” This allows people with low vision and people who use
     assistive technologies to more easily access the information and
     navigate through content.

   Organizations will likely find that inclusive design choices and
   barrier removal make good business sense and will benefit large numbers
   of people. Features installed to ensure that services or residences are
   accessible to people with disabilities also have the potential to meet
   people’s needs as they age, and allow people to “age in
   place.”^[104][146] Offering a range of alternative communication
   methods when providing services will benefit many people with different
   needs, including people with speech and language disabilities, and
   people who identify as deaf, deafened or hard of hearing.^[105][147]

8.3 Appropriate accommodation

   In addition to designing inclusively and removing barriers,
   organizations must respond to individual requests for accommodation.
   The duty to accommodate requires that the most appropriate
   accommodation be determined and provided, unless this causes undue

   hardship. Accommodation is considered appropriate if it results in
   equal opportunity to enjoy the same level of benefits and privileges
   experienced by others or if it is proposed or adopted for the purpose
   of achieving equal opportunity, and meets the individual’s
   disability-related needs. The most appropriate accommodation is one
   that most:
     * respects dignity
     * responds to a person’s individualized needs
     * allows for integration and full participation.

   Accommodation is a process and is a matter of degree, rather than an
   all-or-nothing proposition, and can be seen as a continuum. The highest
   point in the continuum of accommodation must be achieved, short of
   undue hardship.[106]^^[148] At one end of this continuum is full
   accommodation that most respects the person's dignity and promotes
   confidentiality. Alternative accommodation (which would be less than
   “ideal”) might be next on the continuum when the most appropriate
   accommodation is not feasible. An alternative (or “next-best”)
   accommodation may be implemented in the interim while the most
   appropriate accommodation is being phased in or put in place at a later
   date when resources have been put aside.

   Determining the “most appropriate” accommodation is a separate analysis
   from determining whether the accommodation would result in undue
   hardship. If a particular accommodation measure would cause undue
   hardship, the next-best accommodation must be sought.

   At the same time, human rights case law makes it clear that the purpose
   of the Code is to accommodate a person’s needs, not their
   preferences.^[107][149] If there is a choice between two accommodations
   that respond equally to the person’s needs in a dignified way, then the
   accommodation provider is entitled to select the one that is less
   expensive or less disruptive to the organization.^[108][150]

8.3.1 Essential duties and requirements

   Section 17 of the Code says that the right to be free from
   discrimination is not infringed if the person with a disability is
   incapable of performing or fulfilling the essential duties or
   requirements attending the exercise of the right.

   In employment, essential duties are the “vital” or “indispensable”
   aspects of someone’s job. In housing, the essential duties or
   requirements of being a tenant may include paying rent, maintaining
   one’s unit so it does not violate health and safety laws, and allowing
   other people to reasonably enjoy their premises. In the case of
   services, the “essential duties or requirements” of using a service
   will vary depending on the circumstances.

   Section 17 means that someone cannot be judged incapable of performing
   the essential duties of a job, or the essential requirements of being a
   tenant or taking part in a service, unless it can be shown that the
   person’s needs cannot be accommodated

   without undue hardship. An organization should not conclude that a
   person is unable to perform the essential duties without actually
   giving the person an opportunity to demonstrate their ability.

     Example: A doctor enrolled in a residency program required
     accommodation of his ADHD and other disabilities to complete his
     rotations within various teaching hospitals and community practices.
     A human rights tribunal found that he was discriminated against by
     the university offering the program when the university decided,
     based on an “impressionistic conclusion”, that providing the
     accommodation would fundamentally alter the program or lower its
     professional standards. There must be a substantive factual
     foundation to support a conclusion that a person cannot meet an
     essential requirement of a program.^[109][151]

     Example: After coming back from a disability-related leave, a man
     returned to modified duties. Even though his doctor cleared him to
     go back to work full-time, his employer placed him in a lower,
     part-time position at a lower pay rate. He was eventually terminated
     from his employment. The HRTO found that the employer failed to meet
     both its procedural and substantive duty to accommodate. The
     employer violated the Code when it based its decision to place the
     employee in a lower-paying position on its belief about the
     applicant’s ability to perform in the workplace, and continued to
     refuse to provide full-time work, even though this was supported by
     the employee’s doctor. The employer relied on its “non-expert
     opinion” and “stereotypes.” It incorrectly relied on assumptions
     that the employee could not withstand the pressures of his job, and
     that his performance would be unreliable because of his past medical
     condition.^[110][152]

   It is not enough for the organization to assume that a person cannot
   perform an essential requirement of a job, tenancy,
   service, etc. Rather, there must be an objective determination of that
   fact.[111]^^[153] To this end, an individualized assessment will be
   necessary.^[112][154]

   The duty to accommodate does not require exempting a person from
   performing the essential duties of the job,^[113][155] requirements of
   the service, etc. In the context of employment, the duty to accommodate
   does not require an employer to fundamentally change the working
   conditions of employees, assign the essential duties of an employee
   with a disability to other employees or change the essential duties and
   requirements of a position.^[114][156] In these cases, a next-best
   solution, such as alternative work, may need to be found.

     Example: A delivery truck driver’s duties included loading skids of
     product onto a truck, and unloading them at his destination. He
     worked for a small operation whose staff consisted of the owner and
     his wife, a warehouse employee and the delivery truck driver. Due to
     a back injury, the driver was not able to load and unload the truck,
     an essential duty of his job. He requested light duties, preferably
     office work, or relief from loading and unloading the truck. The
     employer denied this request because there were no light duties
     available, and he could not hire an additional person to help the
     driver. The HRTO found that the duty to accommodate does not require
     an employer to assign the essential duties of an employee with a
     disability to other employees or to hire another employee to perform
     them in the employee's place. An employer is also not required to
     change the essential duties and requirements of a position so that
     an employee can meet them.^[115][157]

8.3.2 Employment-specific accommodation issues

8.3.2.1 Alternative work

   There is a duty to accommodate a person in their pre-disability job
   wherever possible. However, it is recognized that this may not always
   be feasible. Human rights case law recognizes that employers have a
   duty to consider temporary and permanent alternative work for people
   who can no longer remain in their position even with
   accommodation.^[116][158] This duty includes diligently investigating
   positions and proposing job options^[117][159] that are within the
   person’s functional limitations.^[118][160]

   Accommodation may include job restructuring, job
   bundling,^[119][161] reassignment to open positions, or retraining for
   alternative positions if that would not constitute undue hardship for
   the employer. Employers should canvass available posts that allow the
   employee to maximize his or her skills and abilities.^[120][162]

   Temporary alternative work

   The term "alternative work" means different work or work that does not
   necessarily involve similar skills, responsibilities and
   compensation.^[121][163] Temporary alternative work may be an
   appropriate accommodation either in a return to work context, or in a
   situation where a disability renders an employee temporarily unable to
   accomplish the pre-disability job. Temporary alternative work can be an
   appropriate accommodation to assist a person where the nature of the
   disability and its limitations are temporary or episodic.

   Permanent alternative work

   When an employee asks to be reinstated in a previous position, the
   employer must make the appropriate inquiries to assess whether the
   employee is fully able to carry out the essential functions of the job.
   The returning employee must be given an opportunity to prove his or her
   ability to perform the pre-disability job.^[122][164] Where the
   employee can no longer perform the pre-disability job, with or without
   accommodation, the employer should consider permanent alternative
   work.^[123][165]

   The duty to accommodate may include some workplace
   reorganization.^[124][166] For example, it may require employers to
   consider placing an employee with a disability into a vacant position
   without requiring that person to compete for the
   position.^[125][167] The vacant position must be vacant within a
   reasonable amount of time, but the employer is not required
   to “promote” the employee. To the greatest extent possible, the vacant
   position must be equivalent to the current one. When reassignment takes
   place, the person must be qualified for the reassigned position.

     Example: An employee with a disability returns from a disability
     leave and is considered for alternative work. There are two other
     positions available at the company. He is generally qualified for
     one of these positions, but does not know how to use a computer
     program that is required to do the essential duties of this job. The
     employer sends the person on a training course to learn the computer
     program. The employee is then qualified for the position.

   The duty to accommodate does not require the employer to completely
   alter the essence of the contract of employment, that is, the
   employee’s duty to perform work in exchange for
   remuneration.^[126][168] The duty to accommodate does not require an
   employer to provide “make work” or “to create a job that is not
   productive or that, in the employer’s view, does not need to be
   done.”^[127][169] Nor is an employer required to employ two employees
   to do the job of one.^[128][170] In the final analysis, the employee
   must be able to perform a useful and productive job for the
   employer.^[129][171]

8.3.2.2 Return to work

   Accommodating a person who has been absent from work may involve any of
   the above forms of accommodation but also raises unique issues. People
   who return to work after an absence related to a Code ground are
   protected by the Code.^[130][172] They generally have the right to
   return to their original job (the pre-disability job). Both employers
   and unions must co-operate in accommodating employees who are returning
   to work. Accommodation is a fundamental and integral part of the right
   to equal treatment in the return to work context.^[131][173]

     Example: In one case, a woman who had been off for several months
     for a series of surgeries informed her employer that she planned to
     return to work. The HRTO found that her employer discriminated
     against her when it required her to provide a “clean bill of
     health,” tried to require her to sign a letter agreeing to a finite
     cap on future medical leave, and asked her to complete a retraining
     period before it would consider whether she could return to work.
     The HRTO affirmed that the woman was entitled to her previous job.
     The employer acted in a discriminatory way when it merely offered to
     consider rehiring her.^[132][174]

   The right of people with disabilities to return to work exists if the
   worker can fulfil the essential duties of the job after accommodation
   short of undue hardship.^[133][175] If a person cannot fulfil the
   essential duties of the pre-disability job, despite the employer's
   effort to accommodate short of undue hardship, the employer still has
   an obligation to canvass alternative work possibilities, as outlined
   above. Ultimately, as stated above, the person with a disability must
   be able to perform a useful and productive job for the employer.

   Under the Code, there is no fixed rule as to how long an employee with
   a disability may be absent before the duty to accommodate has been met.
   This will depend on the ability of the employee to perform the
   essential duties of the job considering the unique circumstances of
   every absence and the nature of the employee’s condition, as well as
   circumstances in the workplace.^[134][176] Also important is the
   predictability of the absence, in terms of when it will end, if it may
   recur and the frequency of the absence. The employee’s prognosis and
   length of absence are also important considerations. It is more likely
   that the duty to accommodate will continue with a better prognosis,
   regardless of the length of absence.

   The duty to accommodate does not necessarily guarantee a limitless
   right to return to work.^[135][177] On the other hand, a return to work
   program that relies on arbitrarily selected cut-offs or that requires
   an inflexible date of return may be challenged as a violation of
   the Code.

     Example: In a case that dealt with a modified work program that
     featured a “90-day” rule that deemed temporary restrictions of more
     than 90 days to be permanent, the HRTO stated: “A general
     employment-related human rights principle is that when an employee
     is temporarily unable to perform a job because of disability, the
     employer is obliged to keep the employee’s job available so that the
     employee can return to it when the disability improves to the point
     the employee can return to the job. This is a form of
     accommodation of the person’s disability related needs. The
     obligation to keep the employee’s job available does not extend
     indefinitely, and is limited by undue hardship involved in keeping
     the job available, but it generally extends for more than three
     months.”^[136][178]

   Ultimately, the test of undue hardship is the relevant standard for
   assessing return to work programs.

8.4 The legal test

   Section 11 of the Code prohibits discrimination that results from
   requirements, qualifications or factors that may appear neutral but
   that have an adverse effect on people identified by Code grounds.
   Section 11 allows an organization to show that a requirement,
   qualification or factor that results in discrimination is nevertheless
   reasonable and bona fide (legitimate). However, to do this, the
   organization must show that the needs of the person cannot be
   accommodated without undue hardship.^[137][179]

   The Supreme Court of Canada has set out a framework for examining
   whether the duty to accommodate has been met.^[138][180] If prima
   facie discrimination (or discrimination on its face) is found to exist,
   a respondent must establish on a balance of probabilities that the
   standard, factor, requirement or rule:
    1. was adopted for a purpose or goal that is rationally connected to
       the function being performed (such as a job, being a tenant, or
       participating in the service)
    2. was adopted in good faith, in the belief that it is necessary for
       the fulfilment of the purpose or goal, and
    3. is reasonably necessary to accomplish its purpose or goal, in the
       sense that it is impossible to accommodate the claimant without
       undue hardship.^[139][181]

   As a result of this test, the rule or standard itself must be inclusive
   of as many people as possible and must accommodate individual
   differences up to the point of undue hardship. This makes sure that
   each person is assessed according to their own personal
   abilities.^[140][182] The ultimate issue is whether the organization or
   individual providing accommodation has shown that they have done so up
   to the point of undue hardship.

   The following non-exhaustive factors should be considered during the
   analysis:^[141][183]
     * whether the accommodation provider investigated alternative
       approaches
       that do not have a discriminatory effect
     * reasons why viable alternatives were not put in place
     * ability to have differing standards that reflect group or
       individual differences and capabilities
     * whether the accommodation provider can meet their legitimate
       objectives in a less discriminatory way
     * whether the standard is properly designed to make sure the desired
       qualification is met without placing undue burden on the people it
       applies to
     * whether other parties who are obliged to assist in the search for
       accommodation have fulfilled their roles.

   Similarly, as mentioned above, section 17 of the Code also creates an
   obligation to accommodate specifically under the ground of disability.

8.5 Forms of accommodation

   Many different methods and techniques will respond to the unique needs
   of people with disabilities. Accommodations may include modifying or
   changing an organization’s:
     * buildings, facilities and services
     * policies and processes
     * procurement and third-party contracts
     * performance standards, conditions and requirements[142]^^[184]
     * decision-making practices
     * work, housing or service culture
     * methods of communication.

   Depending on a person’s individual needs, examples of accommodation may
   include:

   Employment
     * allowing a flexible work schedule^[143][185]
     * modifying job duties^[144][186]
     * modifying policies
     * making changes to the building (for example, installing ramps, hand
       rails, automatic door openers, wider doorways, etc.)
     * modifying workstations (making ergonomic changes, supplying a
       specialized chair, back support, etc.)
     * providing specialized adaptation or assistive devices for
       computers, accessible technology
     * providing alternative ways of communicating with the employee
     * additional training
     * allowing short-term and long-term disability leave
     * job bundling and unbundling^[145][187]
     * alternative work.^[146][188]

   Services
     * providing multiple ways of contacting a service including by phone,
       in person and by regular and electronic mail
     * providing extra time to a service user
     * providing more breaks to a service user, where appropriate
     * making attendance requirements flexible, where possible, if
       non-attendance can be shown to be linked to a disability
     * modifying rules around non-compliance with deadlines, if
       non-compliance can be shown to be linked to a disability^[147][189]
     * modifying “no pets” policies to allow guide dogs^[148][190] and
       other service animals[149]^^[191]
     * considering someone’s disability as a mitigating factor when
       addressing behaviour that would otherwise warrant imposing
       sanctions.^[150][192]

   Housing
     * helping someone fill out application forms (e.g. for social or
       supportive housing)
     * adjusting tenant selection criteria (such as using a guarantor when
       other information, such as credit history or rental history, is not
       available^[151][193])
     * modifying deadlines (such as deadlines to report income changes in
       social and supportive housing)
     * modifying ways that information is communicated to tenants
     * establishing a list of contact supports to call in emergency
       situations
     * making structural modifications to units (for example, installing
       ramps, automatic door openers, wider doorways, etc.)
     * working with outside professionals to address someone’s needs, if
       agreed to by the tenant
     * considering someone’s disability as a mitigating factor when
       addressing behaviour that would otherwise warrant imposing
       sanctions^[152][194]
     * allowing transfers between units.^[153][195]

   Most accommodations are not expensive to provide, and if instituted
   widely, will benefit more than the person requesting the accommodation.

     Example: A tenant in a rental unit develops arthritis. She requests
     that doorknobs in her suite and in common areas such as the laundry
     room be changed from round knobs that are difficult to grip to
     handles that are suitable for people with arthritis. The landlord
     willingly makes this change as it is not an undue hardship to do so.
     It will also benefit other tenants with disabilities in the
     building, as well as people who are aging.

   Accommodation should be a non-coercive, co-operative process that all
   responsible parties take part in. A person’s co-workers, as well as
   other tenants and service users, may have a role to play in helping
   with an accommodation. In these cases, it may be necessary for others
   to know that a person requires an accommodation to facilitate the
   accommodation. However, care must be taken to protect the person’s
   privacy, to not reveal any more information than is necessary, to make
   sure that they are not “singled out,” and that their dignity is
   respected.^[154][196]

   An accommodation provider should take steps to resolve any tension or
   conflict that may occur as a result of resentment on the part of others
   who are expected to help implement an accommodation. In some
   situations, tension may be linked to a lack of awareness about the
   nature of the person’s disability or needs and the requirements of
   the Code.

   Keeping in mind that everyone experiences disability differently,
   accommodation providers are also required to educate themselves about
   the nature and impact of disabilities as part of the procedural duty to
   accommodate,^[155][197] and to dispel any misperceptions or stereotypes
   that employees, other tenants or service staff or users may have about
   people with disabilities^[156][198] that could lead to inequitable
   treatment. Resolving these issues must be done in a way that most
   respects the person’s dignity and privacy. One key approach to doing
   this is to implement anti-harassment, accommodation and sensitivity
   training. Otherwise, tension and conflict could lead to harassment or a
   poisoned environment for the person with the disability.

8.6 Duties and responsibilities in the accommodation process

   The accommodation process is a shared responsibility. Everyone involved
   should co-operatively engage in the process, share information and
   consider potential accommodation solutions. The person with a
   disability is required to:
     * make accommodation needs known to the best of their ability,
       preferably
       in writing, so that the person responsible for accommodation can
       make the requested accommodation^[157][199]
     * answer questions or provide information about relevant restrictions
       or limitations, including information from health care
       professionals^[158][200]
     * take part in discussions about possible accommodation solutions
     * co-operate with any experts whose assistance is required to manage
       the accommodation process or when information is needed that is
       unavailable to
       the person with a disability
     * meet agreed-upon performance standards and requirements, such as
       job standards, once accommodation is provided[159]^^[201]
     * work with the accommodation provider on an ongoing basis to manage
       the accommodation process.

   The accommodation provider is required to:
     * be alert to the possibility that a person may need an accommodation
       even if they have not made a specific or formal request^[160][202]
     * accept the person’s request for accommodation in good faith, unless
       there are legitimate reasons for acting otherwise
     * get expert opinion or advice where needed (but not as a routine
       matter)
     * take an active role in ensuring that alternative approaches and
       possible accommodation solutions are investigated,^[161][203] and
       canvass various forms of possible accommodation and alternative
       solutions^[162][204]
     * keep a record of the accommodation request and action taken
     * communicate regularly and effectively with the person, providing
       updates on the status of the accommodation and planned next
       steps^[163][205]
     * maintain confidentiality
     * limit requests for information to those reasonably related to the
       nature of the limitation or restriction, to be able to respond to
       the accommodation request
     * consult with the person to determine the most appropriate
       accommodation
     * implement accommodations in a timely way,^[164][206] to the point
       of undue hardship
     * bear the cost of any required medical information or documentation
       (for example, the accommodation provider should pay for doctors’
       notes, assessments, letters setting out accommodation
       needs, etc.)^[165][207]
     * bear the cost of required accommodation.

   Although the person seeking accommodation has a duty to assist in
   securing appropriate accommodation that will meet their needs, they are
   not responsible for originating a solution^[166][208] or leading the
   accommodation process. They are also not required to discuss their
   disability-related needs with anyone other than the people directly
   involved in the accommodation process.^[167][209] It is ultimately the
   accommodation provider’s responsibility to implement solutions, with
   the co-operation of the person seeking accommodation. After
   accommodation is provided, the person receiving the accommodation is
   expected to fulfil the essential duties or requirements of the job,
   tenancy, or taking part in a service.

   Contracting with a disability management company does not absolve an
   employer of responsibilities or liability if the accommodation process
   is not managed properly.^[168][210]

   In employment, unions and professional associations are required to
   take an active role as partners in the accommodation process, share
   joint responsibility with the employer to facilitate accommodation, and
   support accommodation measures regardless of collective agreements,
   unless to do so would create undue hardship.^[169][211]

   If the accommodation is required to allow the person to be able to take
   part in the organization without impediment due to disability, the
   organization must arrange and cover the cost of the accommodation
   needed,^[170][212] unless this would cause undue hardship.

   Where a person requires assistance for their disability beyond what is
   required to access housing, employment or services equally, such as an
   assistive device for daily living, the organization would not generally
   be required to arrange or pay for it, but is expected to allow the
   person to access this type of accommodation without impediment.

   Accommodating someone with a disability may be hindered by a lack of
   appropriate disability support services in the community to identify
   someone’s disability-related needs and limitations, or to assist with
   an accommodation. Waiting lists for specialists’ assessments, for
   example, can be extremely long. In these cases, accommodation providers
   should use the best information they have available to make the
   accommodation, or provide interim accommodation, taking into
   consideration how the person identifies their own needs, pending the
   assessment.

8.6.1 Duty to inquire about accommodation needs

   In general, the duty to accommodate a disability exists for needs that
   are known or ought to be known. Organizations and persons responsible
   for accommodation are not, as a rule, expected to accommodate
   disabilities they are unaware of. However, in some circumstances, the
   nature of certain disabilities may leave people unable to identify that
   they have a disability, or that they have accommodation
   needs.^[171][213]

     Example: A forklift operator is prescribed medication to treat
     seizures. Shortly afterward he begins to experience memory lapses,
     including while on the job, and at one point has difficulty
     recalling the established protocol for the safe operation of his
     machinery. His manager notices his uncharacteristic behaviour.
     Rather than taking disciplinary action, the manager sets up a
     meeting and asks the employee if there have been any recent changes
     in his life that could be affecting his behaviour. The employee is
     able to correlate his memory problems to when he began to take his
     anti-seizure medication. In consultation with his doctor, he
     switches to a new medicine and the problem resolves itself.

   Accommodation providers must attempt to help a person who is clearly
   unwell or perceived to have a disability by inquiring further to see if
   the person has needs related to a disability and offering assistance
   and accommodation.^[172][214] Even if an employer has not been formally
   advised of a disability, the perception of such a disability will
   engage the protection of the Code.

     Example: The HRTO found that an employer discriminated against a
     male employee with a visual impairment when it failed to inquire
     into whether he needed accommodation even after it became aware that
     he was experiencing difficulties on the job due to his disability.
     Even though the man did not formally request accommodation, the HRTO
     stated “…the procedural duty to accommodate indicates that an
     employer cannot passively wait for an employee to request
     accommodation where it is aware of facts that indicate that the
     employee may be having difficulties because of disability; there is
     a duty to take the initiative to inquire in these
     circumstances.”^[173][215]

   Where an organization is aware, or reasonably ought to be aware, that
   there may be a relationship between a disability and someone’s job
   performance, or their abilities to fulfil their duties as a tenant or
   service user, the organization has a “duty to inquire” into that
   possible relationship before making a decision that would affect the
   person adversely.^[174][216] This includes providing a meaningful
   opportunity to the employee, tenant or service user to identify a
   disability and request accommodation. A severe change in
   a person’s behaviour could signal that the situation warrants further
   examination.

   Where a person exhibits inappropriate behaviour due to a disability,
   employers, housing providers and service providers have a duty to
   assess each person individually before imposing measures that may
   affect the person negatively. Such measures might include prematurely
   starting eviction proceedings, revoking subsidies, withdrawing services
   or imposing discipline in employment. Before sanctioning a person for
   misconduct
   or “unacceptable behaviour,” an organization must first consider
   whether the actions of the person are caused by a disability,
   especially where the organization is aware or perceives that the person
   has a disability.^[175][217] The person’s disability must be considered
   in determining what, if any, sanctions are appropriate, unless this
   causes undue hardship.

     Example: A boy in Grade 2 regularly interrupts his classmates and
     disrupts the teacher’s lessons. When repeated reminders do not
     improve the problem, the teacher considers her options. Before
     escalating the situation, she contacts his parents to make further
     inquiries. Together, they arrange for an educational assessment
     which reveals that the boy has autism spectrum disorder. They are
     then able to take steps to put the appropriate supports in place to
     help him succeed at school.

   Where the behaviour is not related to a disability, sanctions or
   discipline will generally apply, as usual.^[176][218]

   Accommodation providers should always inform employees, service users
   and tenants that a disability-related assessment (such as a medical
   assessment) or accommodation can be provided as an option to address
   job performance issues or issues relating to fulfilling one’s duties as
   a tenant or a service user.

   In employment, for example, an accommodation provider may be able to
   ask for medical documentation to confirm fitness to work, if there is
   sufficient objective evidence that there are legitimate reasons to be
   concerned.

   Once disability-related needs are known, the legal onus shifts to those
   with the duty to accommodate.^[177][219] For example, support or
   referral through employee assistance programs (EAPs) could be the
   solution for an underlying disability.

8.7 Medical information to be provided

   The provision of medical information by people with disabilities – the
   type, the scope and to whom – has implications for the privacy of
   employees, tenants and service users.^[178][220] At the same time,
   organizations must have enough information to allow them to meet their
   duty to accommodate.

   As stated above, the person seeking accommodation is generally required
   to advise the accommodation provider that they have a disability, and
   the accommodation provider is required to take requests for
   accommodation in good faith.^[179][221] A person with a disability does
   not have to meet an onerous standard for initially communicating that a
   disability exists to trigger the organization’s duty to accommodate.
   Organizations should limit requests for information to those reasonably
   related to the nature of the limitation or restriction, to assess needs
   and make the accommodation.

   The type of information that accommodation seekers may generally be
   expected to provide to support an accommodation includes:
     * that the person has a disability
     * the limitations or needs associated with the disability
     * whether the person can perform the essential duties or requirements
       of the job^[180][222], of being a tenant, or of being a service
       user, with or without accommodation
     * the type of accommodation(s) that may be needed to allow the person
       to fulfill the essential duties or requirements of the job, of
       being a tenant, or of being a service user, etc.
     * in employment, regular updates about when the person expects to
       come back to work, if they are on leave.

     Example: A tenant tells his landlord that he has been hospitalized
     due to a disability and cannot make his rent payment on time.
     Knowing that the person is in hospital, the landlord does not
     require confirmation that the tenant has a disability, but asks for
     information to indicate that his need is temporary in nature, and
     that he will be able to pay his rent once released in a few weeks’
     time. The person provides this information, and the landlord makes
     an allowance for the late payment.

     Example: In one case, a housing co-op sought to evict an occupant
     for failing to perform the two hours of volunteer work each month
     required by the co-op’s by-law, despite the fact that she had
     provided a doctor’s note that she was incapable of performing the
     volunteer work for medical reasons. Even with the note, the co-op
     sought further medical details of her condition, which she refused
     to provide. The Ontario Divisional Court stated that the co-op had a
     duty to respect the rights of its occupants under the Ontario Human
     Rights Code and to accommodate the needs of an occupant with a
     disability, to the point of undue hardship.^[181][223]

   Where there is a reasonable basis to question the legitimacy of a
   person’s request for accommodation or the adequacy of the information
   provided, the accommodation provider may request confirmation or
   additional information from a qualified health care professional to get
   the needed information.

   Where more information about a person’s disability is needed, the
   information requested must be the least intrusive of the person’s
   privacy while still giving the accommodation provider enough
   information to make the accommodation.

   In the rare case where an accommodation provider can show that it
   legitimately needs more information about the person’s disability to
   make the accommodation (as opposed to just the needs related to the
   disability), it could ask for the nature of the person’s illness,
   condition or disability^[182][224] (for example, is it a mental health
   disability, a physical disability, a learning disability?), as opposed
   to a medical diagnosis.

   Organizations are not expected to diagnose illness or “second-guess”
   the health status of a person with a disability. An accommodation
   provider is not entitled to substitute its own opinion for that of
   medical documentation provided by a doctor.^[183][225] Similarly, an
   organization must not ask for more confidential medical information
   than necessary because it doubts the person’s disclosure of their
   disability based on its own impressionistic view of what a specific
   disability should “look like.”^[184][226]

     Example: An employee tells his manager that he has Crohn’s Disease
     and requests time off work to recover from an upcoming surgery
     related to his condition. Although the employee provides medical
     documentation from his family doctor stating that he has a
     disability for which he will require 4 – 6 weeks off to recover from
     surgery, his manager questions the legitimacy of the request, saying
     “I have no one to replace you, and besides, my uncle has had Crohn’s
     Disease for years and he has never had to have surgery.” He insists
     on the employee providing confirmation from his surgeon as well
     before he will consider providing the requested accommodation. This
     could be a violation of the employee’s rights under the Code.

   Generally, the accommodation provider does not have the right to know a
   person’s confidential medical information, such as the cause of the
   disability, diagnosis, symptoms or treatment,^[185][227] unless these
   clearly relate to the accommodation being sought, or the person’s needs
   are complex, challenging or unclear and more information is
   needed.^[186][228] In rare situations where a person’s accommodation
   needs are complex, challenging or unclear, the person may be asked to
   co-operate by providing more information, up to and including a
   diagnosis.^[187][229] In such situations, the accommodation provider
   must be able to clearly justify why the information is needed.

   However, wherever possible, an accommodation provider must make genuine
   efforts to provide needed accommodations without requiring a person to
   disclose a diagnosis, or otherwise provide medical information that is
   not absolutely necessary.

     Example: A woman living with HIV provides medical verification that
     she has a disability to her university’s office for students with
     disabilities. The office helps her to set up a schedule that avoids
     early morning classes, due to the insomnia and fatigue she
     experiences as a side effect of her medication. Neither the office
     nor the woman’s professors need to know the exact nature of her
     disability to make this accommodation.

   Where someone’s needs are unclear, they may be asked to attend an
   independent medical examination (IME). However, there must be an
   objective basis for concluding that the initial medical evidence
   provided is inaccurate or inadequate. The IME should not be used to
   “second-guess” a person’s request for
   accommodation.^[188][230] Requests for medical examinations must be
   warranted, take into account a person’s particular disability-related
   needs, and respect individual privacy to the greatest extent
   possible.^[189][231]

     Example: A woman is employed as a railroad engineer, which is a
     “safety sensitive” position. After being hospitalized for a serious
     concussion resulting from a car accident, she is cleared by her
     doctor to go back to work. However, upon returning, she is evaluated
     and her supervisor notices that she cannot focus well, her reaction
     time is slow, and she makes repeated mistakes. In this case, the
     employer may be justified in asking the employee to attend an
     independent medical examination.^[190][232]

   No one can be made to attend an independent medical examination, but
   failure to respond to reasonable requests may delay the accommodation
   until such information is provided, and may ultimately frustrate the
   accommodation process.

   Mere assertions of symptoms, such as statements that the person
   experiences “stress,” “pain” or “feels unwell” – things that many
   people commonly experience – may not be enough to establish a
   disability within the meaning and protection of human rights
   legislation.[191]^^[233] If choosing to disclose such information in
   writing, individuals and doctors should make it clear that these
   symptoms relate to a disability.

     Example: A man provides a doctor’s note to his employer stating that
     he has been feeling “under the weather” and needs a leave of
     absence. The employer is entitled to ask for more information to
     ascertain whether his condition is linked to a disability. If it is,
     the employer may ask about the person’s restrictions, the expected
     date of return to work, and whether or not the person could still be
     present at work with an accommodation.

   However, where these types of assertions exist alongside other
   indicators that the person is experiencing health problems, and where
   an employer, housing provider or service provider perceives that a
   person may have a disability, the Code’s protection will be triggered.

   Where a person provides disability-related information that an
   accommodation provider deems “insufficient” to enable it to provide
   accommodation, the accommodation provider cannot use its own failure to
   ask for additional information to deny the accommodation or to
   otherwise subject a person to negative treatment (for example,
   termination of employment, denial of service, etc.).^[192][234]

   If the person does not agree to provide additional medical information,
   and the accommodation provider can show that this information is
   needed, it may be the case that the person seeking accommodation could
   be found to not have taken part in the accommodation process and the
   accommodation provider would likely be relieved of further
   responsibility.^[193][235]

   In some cases, there may be conflicting information provided by two
   medical experts. For example, a person’s own doctor or specialist may
   outline different accommodation needs than an independent medical
   examiner’s report. Deciding which report to follow will depend on the
   facts of the particular situation and certain factors, such as which
   expert has more relevant experience, the degree of interaction with the
   person, and the methods used for the assessment(s), among
   others.^[194][236]

8.8 Confidentiality

   Documentation supporting the need for a particular accommodation should
   be provided only to the people who need to be aware of the information.
   For example, in employment, it may be preferable in some circumstances
   for information to be provided to the company's health department or
   human resources staff rather than directly to a supervisor, to further
   protect confidentiality.

     Example: A woman with the beginning stages of multiple sclerosis
     provides medical documentation to her human resources department and
     asks for accommodation. The human resources department agrees to
     help facilitate a flexible schedule, rest periods to manage periods
     of fatigue, and time off to attend medical appointments. It may not
     be necessary for the woman to discuss her medical situation in
     detail with anyone else (e.g. her manager or supervisor) since the
     HR department has the required information to ensure that she has
     the accommodations she needs to remain productive at work.

   A person’s medical information should be kept separately from their
   personnel file, or any file associated with their tenancy or use of a
   service.

   In cases where there are compelling circumstances affecting the health
   and safety of an individual, it may be necessary to disclose
   information about a person’s health to others. This should be done in
   accordance with privacy laws. More information about privacy laws and
   how they apply to public and private housing providers, employers and
   service providers can be found at the Office of the Information and
   Privacy Commissioner of Ontario and the Office of the Privacy
   Commissioner of Canada.^[195][237]

   developed a bad back when it failed to consider what modified light
   duty work it might be able to provide on a permanent basis.

   ^[167] Metsala, supra note 158. The HRTO has identified several “best
   practices” related to this process. For example, in at least two cases
   the HRTO commented favourably on an employer’s practice of canvassing
   vacant positions that match an employee’s disability-related needs and
   qualifications and then “holding” or “‘protecting” those positions to
   make sure that they are not first filled by someone who does not
   require accommodation: see Harnden v. The Ottawa Hospital, 2011 HRTO
   1258 (CanLII) and Gourley, supra note 122. Other cases have confirmed

   required: Fair, supra note 158. See also MacLeod, supra note 158. For

   the basic obligations associated with her employment relationship for
   the foreseeable future” and for that reason the employer’s duty to
   accommodate had come to an end. The HRTO went on to state at para. 36

   ^[183] Meiorin, supra note 66 at para. 65.

   ^[184] The duty to accommodate may require employers and others to
   consider modifying performance standards or productivity
   targets: Meiorin, supra note 66 at para. 65. The term “performance
   standard” refers broadly to qualitative or quantitative standards that
   may be imposed on some or all aspects of work, whether they are set by
   the employer or through collective bargaining. A productivity target is
   a performance standard that relates specifically to the output of work
   expected by the employer. Performance standards generally can be
   distinguished from qualification standards, which are the skills
   or attributes that one must have to be eligible for a particular job:

     Production standards identify the level at which an employee must
     perform job functions in order to perform successfully.
     Qualification standards, on the other hand, identify the skills and
     abilities necessary to perform the functions at the required level.

   (Robert L. Burgdorf, Disability Discrimination in Employment
   Law (Washington D.C.: Bureau of National Affairs, 1995) at 241.)

   The central issue in determining whether or how performance standards
   should be modified is whether the standards in question are essential
   duties or requirements within the meaning of section 17 of the Code. If
   the person is unable to perform the standard, but the standard is not
   considered an essential part of the job, it can be changed or the
   function removed from the employee altogether and reassigned. If the
   standard is essential, the employer is nevertheless required to
   accommodate the employee under section 17(2) of the Code. Keeping in
   mind the overall objective of the inclusion of employees with
   disabilities in the workplace, sections 17(1) and (2) of
   the Code together include an obligation on an employer to accommodate a
   person. This does not preclude the employer from enforcing performance
   standards that are unrelated to the disability. The employer is
   entitled to a productive employee and to develop standards and targets
   that maximize organizational objectives. Organizations should be guided
   by objective evidence when developing or assessing qualification
   standards that they consider are essential duties or requirements. If
   an employer is considering a standard that will be widely adopted, it
   should consider the job duties of employees in different settings that
   are or would be subject to the standard and whether there is a link
   between the standard and the duties of employees: Lauzon v. Ontario
   Provincial Police, 2011 HRTO 1404 (CanLII).

   ^[185] According to Statistics Canada, the most needed accommodation
   for people with disabilities in
   the Canadian workplace is modified/reduced hours. And while this is the
   need most commonly met
   by employers, modified/reduced hours is also “the reason most
   frequently cited for difficulty advancing
   in employment”: Matthew Till, et al., (2015). Canadian Survey on
   Disability, 2012: A Profile of the Labour Market Experiences of Adults

   animals do not have to be trained or certified by a recognized
   disability-related organization. However, where it is not immediately
   obvious that the animal is performing a disability-related service, a
   person must be able to show evidence (such as a letter from a doctor or
   other qualified medical professional) that they have a disability and
   that the animal assists with their disability-related needs. Service
   providers and others who receive such documentation should not use
   their own assumptions and observations to second-guess this
   verification. See Allarie v. Rouble, 2010 HRTO 61 (CanLII); Sweet v.
   1790907 Ontario Inc. o/a Kanda Sushi, 2015 HRTO 433
   (CanLII); Sprague v. RioCan Empress Walk Inc., 2015 HRTO 942
   (CanLII); Schussler v. 1709043 Ontario, 2009 HRTO 2194 (CanLII); Kamis
   v. 1903397 Ontario Inc., 2015 HRTO 741 (CanLII). Section 4 of
   Regulation 429/07 under the AODA, supra note 6, also requires
   organizations to permit a person with a disability to be accompanied by
   their guide dog or service animal on all premises that are normally
   open to the public or third parties, unless the animal is otherwise
   excluded by law from the premises.

   ^[192] For example, some disabilities may result in “acting out”
   behaviours. Education providers and other responsible organizations
   need to take into account whether behaviours that would otherwise
   warrant discipline are related to a disability.

   ^[193] This might apply where a person with a disability does not have
   a rental or credit history to provide to a prospective landlord because
   they have previously only lived as a dependent.

   ^[196] See section 8.8 of this Policy on “Confidentiality” for more
   information.

   ^[197] In Lane, supra note 6, a case involving an employee with a
   mental health disability, the HRTO stated at para. 144: “The procedural
   dimensions of the duty to accommodate required those responsible to
   engage in a fuller exploration of the nature of bipolar disorder and to
   form a better informed prognosis of the likely impact of his condition
   in the workplace.”

   ^[198] See Dawson, supra note 33 at paras. 243-245.

   ^[199] See section 8.6.1 of this Policy on “Duty to inquire about
   accommodation needs” for information on when an organization is
   expected to inquire about accommodation needs, even when a person may
   not have made a specific request.

   ^[200] In Baber, supra note 12, the HRTO found that even if the duty to
   accommodate was triggered,
   the employer had fulfilled its duty to accommodate because Ms. Baber
   failed to co-operate in the accommodation process by refusing
   reasonable requests for information that would confirm her needs. She
   consistently refused to provide the necessary medical information. The
   HRTO found that the employer did not breach its duty to accommodate her
   when it terminated her employment.

   ^[206] In Turnbull, supra note 38, the Board of Inquiry upheld a
   discrimination complaint finding that although Famous Players had taken
   steps to comply with the Code by providing equal access to its movie
   theatres for people with disabilities, it had not done so quickly
   enough, and had failed to act with “due diligence and dispatch” (para.
   216).

   ^[207] Human rights decision-makers have not been consistent on the
   issue of who is responsible for the costs of accommodation (or what
   types of expenses are included in “the costs of accommodation”).
   See Iley v. Sault Ste. Marie Community Information and Career Centre,
   2010 HRTO 1773 (CanLII) in which the HRTO ordered the applicant to
   obtain medical information and stated: “The respondents are… directed
   to reimburse the applicant for the costs of such a production, since it
   is being done at their request.” But also see Drost v. Ottawa-Carleton
   District School Board, 2012 HRTO 235 (CanLII) where, in the context of
   a hearing in which the parties are subject to the HRTO’s rules that
   require that they disclose all arguably relevant documents, the HRTO
   placed the onus of covering the costs of medical information for both
   establishing a disability and outlining the accommodation needs on the
   applicant. It is the OHRC’s position that the procedural component of
   the duty to accommodate – which includes obtaining all relevant
   information and considering how to accommodate – includes a
   responsibility to pay the costs necessary to facilitate accommodation,
   such as medical assessments and doctor’s reports, unless to do so would
   cause undue hardship. This position is consistent with the human rights
   principle that the Code be given a broad, purposive and contextual
   interpretation to advance the goal of eliminating discrimination.

   970, [Renaud].

   ^[209] In DeSouza, supra note 12, the HRTO found that a tennis club
   discriminated against a tennis instructor based on disability when it
   imposed requirements on the instructor that he tell all private clients
   about his epilepsy and instruct all staff on how to deal with a
   seizure.

   ^[213] For example, people with mental health disabilities experiencing
   a first episode of a disability may be unaware that they are
   experiencing impairment. Also, denying the presence of a disability may
   be an aspect of having an addiction. For more information on mental
   health disabilities and addictions, see the OHRC’s Mental Health

   ^[219] In Morris v. British Columbia Railway Co. (2003), 46 C.H.R.R.
   D/162, 2003 BCHRT 14 [Morris], a tribunal found that if performance
   problems related to a disability are a reason for the termination, the
   disability is a factor in the termination. Knowing of the claimant’s
   condition, the employer should have considered whether the disability
   was affecting his performance and sought further medical assessment. It
   failed to do so. The case also confirms that an employer can’t “blind
   itself to its observations of an employee's behaviour…All relevant
   factors must be considered by an employer dealing with an employee with
   a disability, including medical evidence, its own observations, and the
   employee's own comments and concerns.” (at para. 238).

   ^[220] Many disabilities continue to be highly stigmatized (e.g. mental
   health disabilities, addictions, HIV and AIDS), and many people may be
   justifiably worried that sharing personal medical information will make
   them vulnerable to discrimination.

   ^[221] Morris, supra note 219; Yeats, supra note 155 at paras. 47-8.

   ^[222] For more information on human rights issues in the job
   recruitment process, see the OHRC’s Policy

   ^[223] The Court applied the Code and the OHRC’s 2001 Disability
   Policy and held that it would have been reasonable and appropriate for
   the co-op to obtain answers from the occupant’s doctor to determine if
   any of the volunteer tasks could be performed, notwithstanding her
   medical condition. If so, it could have accommodated her by assigning
   her tasks she could perform, but if not, the cost of accommodating her
   by exempting her from the volunteer work requirement would be unlikely
   to impose an undue hardship. The Court concluded that it would be
   unjust in all the circumstances to evict the
   occupant: Eagleson, supra note 12.

   ^[224] In Providence Care, Mental Health Services v. Ontario Public
   Service Employees Union, Local 431, 2011 CanLII 6863 (ON LA), the
   arbitrator distinguishes the “nature of disability” from a “diagnosis”
   by saying at para. 33: “However, I continue to be of the view that
   nature of illness (or injury) is a general statement of same in plain
   language without an actual diagnosis or other technical medical details
   or symptoms. Diagnosis and nature of illness are not synonymous terms,
   but there is an overlap between them, such that a description of the
   nature of an illness or injury may reveal the diagnosis and in
   others it will not.”

   ^[225] See Duliunas, supra note 44; Devoe, supra note 12;
   and, Eagleson, supra note 12.

   ^[226] See Morris, supra note 219; Russell, supra note 44. But also
   see Oak Bay Marina Ltd. v. British Columbia (Human Rights Tribunal)
   (No. 2) (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D/487, 2002 BCCA 495 [Oak Bay].

   ^[227] In Simpson v. Commissionaires (Great Lakes), 2009 HRTO 1362
   (CanLII), the HRTO stated at para. 35:

     For the purposes of a request for employment accommodation,
     generally the focus should be on the functional limitations of the
     employee’s condition (capacities and symptoms) and how those
     functional aspects interact with the workplace duties and
     environment. Consequently, an employer need not be informed of the
     specific cause of the employee’s condition or the exact diagnosis in
     order to be put on notice that an employee has disability-related
     needs requiring accommodation.

   Similarly, in Cristiano v. Grand National Apparel Inc., 2012 HRTO 991
   (CanLII), the HRTO stated at para. 20: “There are limits on what a
   respondent can require of its employees claiming a need for a medical
   leave. For example, in most instances, an employer is not entitled to a
   diagnosis. But an employer is entitled to know enough to make some
   assessment of the bona fides of the leave request and sufficient
   information to determine what if any accommodations might be made…” See
   also Wall, supra note 215; Mellon, supra note 214; Leong v. Ontario
   (Attorney General), 2012 HRTO 1685 (CanLII); Noe, supra note
   50; Ilevbare, supra note 44; Jarrold v. Brewers Retail Inc. (c.o.b.
   Beer Store), 2014 HRTO 1070 (CanLII); Easthom v. Dyna-Mig, 2014 HRTO
   1457(CanLII) .

   ^[228] A person may have more rigorous obligations to disclose medical
   information in the context of litigation. In Hicks v.
   Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board¸ 2015 HRTO 1285
   (CanLII), the HRTO stated at paragraph 17: “Where there is a dispute
   about the medical status of an employee further medical information may
   be required and where, as in these circumstances, there is litigation
   with respect to the dispute the parties will be entitled to much more
   fulsome disclosure of the medical documentation than might be the case
   in other circumstances.” See also Fay v. Independent Living Services,
   2014 HRTO 720(CanLII) .

   ^[229] Where there is a reasonable basis to question the legitimacy of
   a person’s request for accommodation or the adequacy of the information
   provided, an accommodation provider may be entitled to medical
   confirmation that a diagnosis exists, though this would not normally
   include disclosure of a person’s specific diagnosis. Accommodation
   providers should keep in mind that diagnoses for certain disabilities
   can be difficult to get, may change over time and may result in vastly
   different symptoms and experiences for different people. Therefore, a
   general statement that a person has a disability and identifying what a
   person needs in relation to their functional limitations is often more
   helpful to the accommodation process than a diagnosis.
   See Mellon, supra note 214 at para. 99: “An individual with a
   disability…may not know the exact nature and extent of that disability
   at the time they are experiencing the symptoms. In such circumstances,
   we cannot impose a duty to disclose a conclusive medical diagnosis.”
   Some people may present with a set of symptoms, but without a specific
   diagnosis. See Ball, supra note 56.

   ^[230] See Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 831 v. Brampton
   (City) [2008] O.L.A.A. No. 359 [C.U.P.E.].

   ^[231] The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has found that requests for a
   person with autism to undergo a psychiatric examination after asking
   for a leave of absence because of workplace harassment was in itself a
   form of harassment. It stated, “Indeed, the evidence shows that the
   Respondent remained deaf to the pleas of Ms. Dawson who did not want to
   see a physician whom she did not know and who knew nothing about
   autism, of her union representatives who expressed concern and
   consternation about Ms. Dawson having to submit to a medical
   examination by a Canada Post designated physician, but more
   importantly, of her treating physician who stated that she was very
   concerned that this could provoke a serious emotional reaction from Ms.
   Dawson. …However well-intended Canada Post management was in seeking a
   medical evaluation, the Tribunal finds that, in the present
   circumstances, the general behaviour of those Canada Post employees who
   were involved in the medical evaluation process constitutes
   harassment.” See Dawson, supra note 33 at paras. 216 and 219. For
   arbitration cases that have found that treatment requirements imposed
   by employers interfered with employees’ privacy, see: Central Care
   Corp. v. Christian Labour Assn. of Canada, Local 302 (Courtney
   Grievance), [2011] O.L.A.A. No. 144; Federated Cooperatives Ltd. v.
   General Teamsters, Local 987 (Policy Grievance) (2010), 194 L.A.C.
   (4th) 326; and, Brant Community Healthcare System v. Ontario Nurses’
   Assn. (Medical Form Grievance), [2008] O.L.A.A. No. 116, in which the
   arbitrator stated: “Treatment modalities are a matter for the doctor
   and the patient.”

   ^[232] See, for example, Oak Bay, supra note 226.

   ^[233] In one case, a doctor’s note stating that a woman had a “medical
   condition” was considered insufficient to establish that she had a
   disability as per the meaning of the Code: see Simcoe Condominium
   Corporation No. 89 v. Dominelli, 2015 ONSC 3661 (CanLII) .

1. Introduction

   This part concentrates on goods liable to excise duty. It lists the
   rates of excise duty chargeable for the following:
     * wine and made-wine
     * beer
     * cider and perry
     * spirits
     * low alcohol beverages
     * imported composite goods containing alcohol
     * tobacco products
     * hydrocarbon oil — this section includes details about rebates for
       such products
     * Climate Change Levy
     * biofuels

   Use this guide with the [56]Trade Tariff: look up commodity codes, duty
   and VAT rates to help with commodity code numbers (for example, 2204 10
   11 for certain wines).

   This part also contains some information and reference about excise
   drawback and excise duty reliefs.

1.1 Important note on definitions

   The definitions used in this part are those prescribed for excise duty
   purposes only.

1.2 Background

   Excise duty is chargeable, in addition to any customs duty which may be
   due, on the goods described in this part. These goods may be either of
   UK origin, received in the UK following an intra EU movement or
   imported from outside the UK or EU.

   The duty falls due at the time when the goods leave any duty suspension
   arrangements, that is when:
     * they are released for consumption or otherwise made available for
       consumption (generally through the warehouse system) registered
       trader (REDS) or occasional importer receives them in the UK
     * a vendor makes a delivery under distance selling arrangements
     * missing consignments and other dutiable shortages are discovered
     * goods imported for personal use are then sold or put to commercial
       use

1.3 Tax type code

   Different rates can apply to different sub categories of goods. In
   addition to the commodity description and code number each excisable
   item has allocated a tax type code number (for example, 451 for
   spirits). These identify the type and rate of excise duty payable. They
   are included in the tables listed in section [57]Wine and made-wine.
   [58]UK Trade Tariff: Box 47(a) tax type codes also lists tax codes
   which are declared on the Single Administrative Document (SAD) import
   document.

   Reduced rates of duty were introduced from 1 June 2002 for beer
   produced by independent breweries producing no more than 30,000
   hectolitres. For breweries producing between 5,000 and 30,000
   hectolitres, the following arithmetical formula is used to calculate
   the rate of duty.

   (Annual production — 2,500) ÷ annual production × standard rate of duty
   at the time concerned. This must be rounded up to the nearest penny.

   Reduced rates of duty were also introduced from 1 June 2004 for beer
   produced by independent breweries producing between 30,000 and 60,000
   hectolitres.

   The following arithmetical formula is used to calculate the rate of
   duty for these breweries.

   (Annual production — (2,500 — 8.3% ABV of annual production in excess
   of 30,000 hectolitres)) × standard rate of duty at the time concerned ÷
   annual production.

   This must be rounded up to the nearest penny.

3.1 Definitions and notes

   ‘Beer’ includes ale, porter, stout and any other description of beer
   and any liquor which is sold as beer or as a substitute for beer and on
   analysis a sample is found to be of an alcoholic strength exceeding
   0.5%. ABV is the proportion of alcohol as a percentage of the fermented
   beer.

   The duty is charged on alcoholic strength to one decimal place, for
   example 4.19% ABV becomes 4.1% ABV (ignore figures after the first
   decimal place).

   Low alcohol beverages made from malt exceeding 0.5% ABV but not
   exceeding 1.2% ABV are not liable to excise duty.

   Examples of beer-based beverages are set out in the section on [61]Low
   alcohol beverages which also shows the rate of excise duty for these
   products up to 5.5% ABV. Beer and spirits mixtures exceeding 1.2% ABV
   are liable to duty at the spirits rate. Beer mixtures containing
   dutiable liquors other than spirits and exceeding 5.5% ABV are liable
   at the appropriate made-wine rate.

   Small brewery beer relief will still be available on the general Beer
   Duty element of beer above 7.5% ABV. However, it will not apply to high
   strength Beer Duty and no further relief will be applied to the reduced
   rate of general Beer Duty for lower strength beers.

4. Cider and perry

   Cider (or perry) — manufactured in the UK by a registered maker of
   cider or perry or imported.
   Class or description Tax type code Rate of excise duty

   8.5% ABV 485 £288.10 per hectolitre
   Sparkling made in the UK or imported exceeding 1.2% ABV but not
   exceeding 5.5% ABV 481 £40.38 per hectolitre
   Still made in the UK or imported exceeding 1.2% ABV but less than 6.9%
   ABV 481 £40.38 per hectolitre
   Still made in the UK or imported at least 6.9% ABV but not exceeding
   7.5% ABV 487 £50.71 per hectolitre
   Still made in the UK or imported exceeding 7.5% ABV but less than 8.5%
   ABV 483 £61.04 per hectolitre
   If total abv does not exceed 1.2% ABV 431 Nil

4.1 Definitions and notes

   ‘Cider’ means cider (or perry) of a strength of less than 8.5% of ABV
   (at 20°C) obtained from the fermentation of apple or pear juice without
   the addition at any time of any alcoholic liquor or of any liquor or
   substance which communicates colour or flavour other than such as the
   Commissioners may allow as appearing to them to be necessary to produce
   cider (or perry).

   Cider or perry is chargeable at the sparkling rate (a) if the container
   has an excess pressure due to carbon dioxide in solution of 3 bar or
   more, or (b) if the container has a mushroom stopper held in place by a
   tie or fastening — regardless of the pressure.

   See section on [62]Wine and made-wine for definition of ‘mushroom
   stopper.’

5. Spirits

   Class or description — UK-produced whisky Tax type code Rate of excise
   duty
   Wholly malt 461 £28.74 per litre of alcohol in the spirits at a

   temperature of 20°C

5.1 Notes

   If spirits are imported in bottles which the importer does not wish to
   be opened for test, HMRC will normally be prepared to accept excise
   duty on the basis of a declared strength of 77% ABV volume for
   drinkable spirits. HMRC reserves the right to test any consignment.

6. Low alcohol beverages

   Wine where the alcohol strength does not exceed 5.5% ABV.

   Made-wine where the alcohol strength does not exceed 5.5% ABV.

   Mixed drinks made from cider or perry base where the alcohol strength
   does not exceed 5.5% ABV.

   Beer-based beverage duty only applies to beverages of an alcoholic
   strength exceeding 1.2% ABV but not exceeding 5.5% ABV.

   There are 2 different rates of duty for a beer-based beverage:
     * one where the alcohol by volume content exceeds 1.2% ABV but does
       not exceed 2.8% ABV
     * the other where the alcohol by volume content exceeds 2.8% ABV but
       does not exceed 5.5% ABV

   Class or description Tax type code Rate of excise duty
   Not exceeding 1.2% volume 431 Nil
   Exceeding 1.2% volume but not exceeding 4.0% 433 £91.68 per hectolitre
   Exceeding 4.0% volume but not exceeding 5.5% 435 £126.08 per hectolitre

   nearest 0.1%
   Beer-based beverages made in the UK exceeding 1.2% volume but not
   exceeding 2.8% volume 444 £8.42 for each hectolitre per 1% ABV charged
   to the nearest 0.1%
   Beer-based beverage exceeding 2.8% volume but not exceeding 5.5% 473
   £19.08 per hectolitre for every 1% ABV to the nearest 0.1%

6.1 Definitions and notes

   Beer-based beverage duty only applies to beverages of an alcoholic
   strength exceeding 1.2% ABV but not exceeding 5.5% ABV and cannot be
   dutiable as a ‘made-wine’.

   This does not include cider, perry and beer as defined in sections for
   [63]cider and perry and [64]beer. The following are classified as
   beer-based beverages:
     * shandy made with lemonade, or a mixture of beer and lemonade, lemon
       cordial, lemon flavouring, lemon juice, or lemon squash
     * lager-and-lime, or a mixture of beer and lime cordial, lime
       flavouring, lime juice, lime squash, or limeade
     * ginger beer shandy, shandygaff, or a mixture of beer and ginger,
       ginger cordial, ginger flavouring, ginger squash, or unfermented
       ginger beer
     * a mixture of beer and:
          + fruit cordial, fruit flavourings, fruit flavoured carbonated
            water, fruit juice or fruit squash
          + any alcoholic liquor or other alcoholic substance

   A reduced rate of general Beer Duty should be applied to beer-based
   beverages of an alcoholic strength exceeding 1.2% ABV but not exceeding
   2.8% ABV. The tax type codes 444 or 446 should be used based on the
   origin of the product. Note these are identical to the tax type codes
   for low alcohol beer found in chapter 3. Where the beer-based beverage
   is of an alcoholic strength exceeding 2.8% ABV but not exceeding 5.5%
   ABV then the tax type code 473 should be used regardless of origin.

7. Imported composite goods containing alcohol

   Goods containing ingredients liable to excise duty are chargeable with:
     * Customs Duty where appropriate on the goods as a whole
     * excise duty on the ingredient

   The tax type codes and excise duty rates are the same as for the type
   of alcohol used as the ingredient, for example, spirits (451) £28.74
   per litre of alcohol.

7.1 Exceptions

   Class or description Excise duty

8.1 Definitions and notes

   For the purposes of Tobacco Products Duty, tobacco products are defined
   in the Tobacco Products (Descriptions of Products) Order 2003 SI
   2003/1471. The following is a summary of those definitions.

   ‘Tobacco products’ means any of the [67]products listed which are
   manufactured wholly or partly from tobacco or any substance used as a
   substitute for tobacco but does not include herbal smoking products.

   ‘Cigarettes’ means any roll of tobacco capable of being smoked as they
   are and not falling within any of the descriptions of a cigar, or rolls
   of tobacco that, by simple non-industrial handling, are:
     * inserted into cigarette-paper tubes
     * wrapped in cigarette paper

   Any cigarette more than 9 centimetres (cm) long (excluding any filter
   or mouthpiece) will be treated as if each 9cm or part thereof were a
   separate cigarette.

   ‘Cigars’ include products of the following descriptions.

   (1) rolls of tobacco made entirely of natural tobacco.

   (2) rolls of tobacco, even if mixed with substances other than tobacco,
   with an outer wrapper of natural tobacco.

   (3) rolls of tobacco with a threshed blend filler of tobacco or tobacco
   mixed with substances other than tobacco, with a binder and outer
   wrapper of reconstituted tobacco.

   The outer wrapper must have the normal colour of a cigar and be fitted
   in spiral form with an acute angle of at least 30 degrees to the
   longitudinal axis of the cigar. The outer wrapper must cover the cigar
   in full including any filter but not (in the case of cigars with a
   mouthpiece) the mouthpiece.

   Cigars falling within this description must have a unit weight
   (excluding filter or mouthpiece) of not less than 1.2 grams (gm).

   (4) rolls of tobacco with a threshed blend filler of tobacco or tobacco

   reconstituted tobacco.

   Cigars falling within this definition must have a unit weight
   (excluding any filter or mouthpiece) of not less than 2.3gm and a

9. Hydrocarbon oil

   The Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979 (HODA) specifies full rates of
   excise duty on mineral oils and rebates of duty. The effect of applying
   a rebate of duty to a full rate is to create a lower rate of duty.
   These lower rates are known as rebated rates. This mechanism increases
   the number of effective rates of mineral oils excise duty.

   Eligibility for rebate, as set out, is restricted as follows.

   Light oil furnace fuel — must be delivered marked and dyed ([71]Excise
   Notice 179, paragraph 8.4), or unmarked under individual ‘supplier’ or
   ‘user’ marking waiver.

   Unleaded petrol — qualifies for rebate without marking or other
   restriction provided it [72]meets the definition.

   Aviation turbine kerosene — may be delivered unmarked, for example, as
   aircraft fuel under marking waiver ([73]Excise Notice 179).

   Other kerosene — must be marked ([74]Excise Notice 179, paragraph 8.4)
   unless delivered under an individual ‘user or dealer’ marking waiver
   (Excise Notice 179), or imported in containers not exceeding 2.5 litres

   other restriction, provided it is not intended for use as road fuel or
   road fuel extender.

   Markers must not be present in any oil (whether light or heavy)
   imported for delivery as road fuel or road fuel extender. The
   prohibitions relating to markers and obscuration of markers which must
   be observed are set out in [76]Excise Notice 179.

   The excise duty on hydrocarbon oil removed to a refinery, instead of
   being charged at the time of importation, is charged on the delivery of
   any goods from the refinery for home use, and is the same as that which
   would be payable on the importation of like goods. It is therefore
   allowed the same rebate as would be allowed on importation. Any customs
   duty chargeable is payable when the oil is taken into use at the
   refinery, whether as feedstock or otherwise.

   From 15 October 1993 the unit for calculation of duty on hydrocarbon
   oils is the standard litre, that is, litres at 15°C. If not already
   expressed in those terms quantities will need to be converted. Further
   information can be found in [77]Excise Notice 179 Appendix l.’

   It’s illegal for any person to mix any oil on which no rebate of excise
   duty has been allowed with:
     * fuel oil, gas oil, kerosene or light oil (including unleaded
       petrol) on which rebate of excise duty has been allowed
     * oil delivered without payment of excise duty

   except under and in accordance with either an approval granted by the
   Commissioners under the Mixing Regulations or a licence granted by the
   Commissioners.

   For excisedDuty purposes the methods of test whether any material is
   solid or semi-solid at a temperature of 15°C, and for the distillation
   characteristics of oil, are those laid down by the Institute of
   Petroleum and the Standardisation of Tar Products Test Committee.
   Further information can be found in [78]Notice 179, Appendix C.

10. Imported composite goods containing mineral oils

   Goods containing mineral oils as a part or ingredient of them are not
   liable to excise duty unless they are intended for use as substitutes
   for road fuels or as additives to road fuels or road fuel substitutes.
   Any articles imported for these purposes are chargeable with UK excise
   duty on 100% of their volume (not only on the percentage of mineral
   oil, if any, contained within them). The tax type codes and excise duty
   rates to be applied are the same as for the type of mineral oil which
   the product is intended to substitute for or is to be added to.

   Lubricating oils will not be charged with UK excise duty unless they
   are to be added to an additives package, in which case excise duty will
   be charged on the whole package.

       compressed natural gas (CNG) used as fuel in road vehicles are not
       liable to the levy
     * LPG when used for heating purposes is not subject to mineral oils

   ‘Biodiesel’ is a diesel quality liquid fuel produced from biomass or
   waste cooking oil:
     * the total ester content of which is not less than 96.5% by weight
     * the sulphur content of which does not exceed 0.005% by weight

   ‘Bioblend’ is a fuel which is a mix of heavy oil and biodiesel in
   varying ratios.

   ‘Bioethanol’ is a liquid fuel consisting of ethanol produced from
   biomass and is capable of being used for the same purpose as light oil.

   r-2023

Who is likely to be affected

   Manufacturers, importers, distributors, retailers and consumers of
   tobacco products. Tobacco products include cigarettes, cigars,
   hand-rolling tobacco, other smoking tobacco and chewing tobacco,
   tobacco for heating and herbal smoking products.

General description of the measure

   This measure sets out how tobacco duties will increase on 22 November
   2023.

Policy objective

   The government is committed to maintaining high tobacco duty rates.
   This is an established tool to reduce smoking prevalence and ensure
   that tobacco duties continue to contribute to government revenues.

   The ‘tobacco duty escalator’, which increases duty in line with the
   Retail Price Index (RPI) +2% at each Budget, was extended at Budget
   2020 until the end of the current Parliament. In addition, increasing
   the duty rate on hand-rolling tobacco above the duty escalator will
   narrow the gap between hand-rolling tobacco and cigarette duty rates.

Background to the measure

   As announced at Autumn Statement 2023, the duty rate on all tobacco
   products will increase by the tobacco duty escalator of 2% above RPI
   inflation. The duty rate for hand-rolling tobacco will rise by an
   additional 10%, to 12% above RPI inflation. These changes will apply
   from 6pm on 22 November 2023.

Detailed proposal

Operative date

   The new tobacco duty rates will have effect from 6pm on 22 November
   2023.

Current law

   The table of duty rates on tobacco products is in Schedule 1 to the
   Tobacco Products Duty Act 1979 (TPDA).

Proposed revisions

   Legislation will be introduced in Autumn Finance Bill 2023 to increase
   the rates of duty on tobacco products. The legislation will amend
   Schedule 1 to the TPDA and makes consequential changes to the
   simplified calculations contained within the Travellers’ Allowances
   Order 1994.

Summary of impacts

Exchequer impact (£ million)

   2023 to 2024 2024 to 2025 2025 to 2026 2026 to 2027 2027 to 2028 2028
   to 2029
   +40 +85 +90 +95 +100 +100

   These figures are set out in table 5.1 of Autumn Statement 2023 and
   have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility. More
   details can be found in the policy costings document published
   alongside Autumn Statement 2023.

Economic impact

   This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic
   impacts.

Impact on individuals, households and families

   This measure will impact on individuals who smoke by increasing the
   price of tobacco products. Heavy smokers will face the highest burden
   from this measure.

   In response to higher prices, some individuals could choose to consume
   less, some could down-trade from more expensive to cheaper tobacco
   products and others could engage in cross-border shopping or purchase
   from the illicit tobacco market. HMRC will monitor and respond to any
   potential shift in illicit consumption as part of its strategy to
   combat tobacco fraud.

   Customer experience is expected to stay broadly the same as this
   measure only increases the price of tobacco products.

   The measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability,
   or breakdown.

Equalities impacts

   Due to differences in tobacco consumption, any change to tobacco duties
   will have equalities impacts. Men (14.6%)  are slightly more likely to
   smoke than women (11.2%).

   Younger people are also more likely to smoke than older people. People
   aged 25 to 34 years have the highest proportion of smokers (16.3%).
   Over 65s having the lowest proportion of smokers (8.3%).

Impact on business including civil society organisations

   This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on fewer than 30
   manufacturers and importers. They will face an increase in tobacco duty
   rates that they are likely to pass on to consumers.

   There will be a negligible one-off cost to these businesses of
   familiarisation and amending systems to reflect the new rates. It is
   not expected there will be any continuing costs.

   Customer experience is expected to stay broadly the same as this
   measure does not present a significant change for tobacco manufacturers
   and importers.

   There is no impact on civil society organisations.

Operational impact (£ million) (HMRC or other)

   HMRC will need to make changes to IT systems to deliver this change, at
   an estimated cost of £30,000.

Other impacts

   Health impact assessment: any reduction in smoking prevalence will have
   a positive impact on health and reduce the cost to the NHS of
   smoking-related illness. There may be reductions in other costs that
   arise from tobacco use.

   These costs include losses in productivity from smoking breaks and
   ill-health absences, the cost of cleaning up cigarette butts, the cost
   of smoking-related house fires and the loss in economic output from
   people who die from diseases related to smoking or exposure to
   second-hand smoke.

   Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified.

Monitoring and evaluation

   The measure will be monitored through information collected from tax
   receipts.

   Enquiries Helpline on Telephone: 0300 200 3700.

What is Duty of Care?

   By definition, Duty of Care is a legal obligation imposed on an
   organisation, requiring adherence to a standard of reasonable care
   while preventing any acts that could foreseeably harm others. This
   article explains the role of an employer in fulfilling their Duty of
   Care obligations, the future of Duty of Care and the best practices and
   recommendations for your organisation.

Duty of Care by definition

   First referenced in the landmark case of [11]Donoghue v Stevenson in
   1932, Duty of Care has historically been connected to legal negligence.
   Over the past century however, the context of the term has drastically
   broadened, impacting organisations of all sizes.

   By definition, Duty of Care is a legal obligation imposed on an
   organisation, requiring adherence to a standard of reasonable care
   while preventing any acts that could foreseeably harm others.

   Much more than providing necessary employee benefits and insurance,[12]
   Duty of Care in the context of the modern workplace encompasses the
   protection of an employee’s health, safety, security and wellbeing.
   Whether on a remote site, at the office, on business travel, on an
   international assignment or working from home, the Duty of Care
   obligations remain and the absence of reasonable measures to prevent
   incidents may undermine an employee’s health and security and
   compromise the organisation’s performance.

The impact of overlooking your Duty of Care responsibilities

   Legal ramifications have historically accounted for the primary concern
   of overlooking Duty of Care responsibilities. In a broader sense, the
   lack of demonstration to protect employees has also resulted in
   reputational damage, loss of productivity, increased employee turnover
   as well as overall cost.

   As negligent cases take over the headlines of global news networks, the
   awareness of Duty of Care has been made apparent on a global scale. The
   COVID-19 pandemic played an important part in this heightened
   awareness, especially from the viewpoint of employees. Growing concerns
   and expectations from employees have been brought to the fore,
   requesting more from their employers when it comes to proactively
   protecting their health, safety, security and wellbeing. Organisations
   seen to not open dialogue to their employees’ needs have also faced
   public repercussions.

Responsibilities of an employer

   As an organisation that employs a workforce operating in varying
   environments, demonstrating your Duty of Care responsibilities should
   be at the core of your corporate policies.
   Although the legal specifications may vary based on location, size and
   industry, our experts have outlined the critical responsibilities
   employers need to consider in 2023:
     * Taking ownership of the concept of Duty of Care: A solid
       understanding of the theory around Duty of Care is essential.
       Nevertheless, for an effective and viable implementation within
       one’s organisation, the latter must take ownership of the concept
       of Duty of Care. To do so, they must consider their organisation’s
       specificities for a bespoke application. These will help determine
       the scope of Duty of Care.
     * Know the typology of your organisation (SME, MNC, NGO, etc.) - know
       your human, tangible, and intangible assets, your footprint around
       the world, current and future developments/expansion projects, the
       types of risks the organisation is exposed to/may be exposed to.
     * Understand your corporate culture: the resulting policies must be
       in harmony with the corporate culture, which is defined by
       attitudes, values and practices. This will ease adhesion by both
       staff and senior management, creating a virtuous cycle for
       acceptance, and implementation.
     * Determine the demographics covered: While it may be obvious for
       many to cover all employees, question whether interns, contractors,
       digital nomads are fully covered and integrated in your policies.
     * Map and navigate the various internal stakeholders that will
       inevitably engage with Duty of Care considerations (employees,
       direct managers, security managers, HR, international mobility,
       legal, purchasing, risk manager, insurance, etc.).
     * Have the support of your top management: Top management must be
       convinced by the importance and the benefits of having a robust
       Duty of Care policy in place. To gain their support, they must
       understand what the risks are of not having a policy in place, what
       other organisations in the same industry are doing and how success
       will be measured.
     * Understanding your employees’ risks: A workforce, regardless of
       size, is likely to be diverse. That diversity can create varying
       risk profiles which as an employer, you should be aware of. Through
       open communication methods, transparency and trust, your employees
       should understand the intent, and benefit of sharing their
       individualistic demographics from health risks to pre-existing
       conditions or sexual orientation and feel safe to do so. In
       addition, the risk profiles of your employees will drastically
       change based on the location they work in or travel to, and need to
       be mitigated accordingly.
     * Proactive education and training: Once you have a broad
       understanding of your employees’ risk profiles, offering the
       respective education and training is key to empowering effective
       decision making. Whether through email, webinars, [13]digital
       training, workshops, bulletins or events, your employees should
       have multiple touch points to understand how to best mitigate risks
       and where to find the necessary information. They should also be
       aware of the organisation’s policies and how to raise questions and
       concerns.
     * Duty of Care in crisis: Although Duty of Care responsibilities
       should exist on a day-to-day basis, they become all the more
       critical in times of crisis. When time is of the essence, the
       immediate objective is to know if your people are in the impacted
       location and if they are safe. The [14]importance of tracking and
       communicating with your employees plays a key role in a [15]crisis
       management response.
     * Review, revise and re-assess: As Duty of Care obligations are
       spread across departments, the revision of corporate policies and
       procedures should take place on a predefined and regular basis and
       in collaboration with internal and, where relevant, external
       stakeholders. There should be fluidity in your Duty of Care
       framework as your workforce, operations and global environment of
       operations change.

The future of Duty of Care

   As the risks to employees evolve, so too will the Duty of Care
   responsibilities of employers. As pandemics, global security incidents
   and economic pressures rise, risk prevention measures need to remain
   coherent.
   Although the frequency and volatility of these incidents may continue
   to rise, the foundational Duty of Care responsibilities still apply.
   The demonstration by an organisation to protect their people from harm,
   both physical and psychological, will maintain precedence.

   A rise in employee expectations will likely persist as flexible working
   patterns, remote working and extended benefits become the new norm.
   After the times of the great resignation, the needs of employees are
   being more widely heard and feedback mechanisms put in place.

Best practices and recommendations

     * Carry out a regular risk assessment, especially if opening new
       operations in a location or sending employees abroad.
     * Communicate regularly and often with your employees to instil
       confidence and peace of mind.
     * Engage with an assistance provider to enable your organisation to
       protect the health, safety, security and wellbeing of your people
       on a 24/7 basis. With a global footprint, and on-the-ground
       expertise, they can advise and support your employees, regardless
       of location.
     * Invest in digital tools to leverage tracking, monitoring and
       information. Utilising an app for your employees to access the
       latest health and security information, sends the most relevant
       location-based alerts and identifies and communicates with
       vulnerable employees in times of crisis.

   The Office for Students (OfS) monitors what higher education providers
   do to prevent people being drawn into terrorism.

What is the Prevent duty?

   The Prevent duty aims to safeguard people from becoming terrorists or
   supporting terrorism.

   The government created [45]two sets of statutory guidance to support
   the strategy, one of which is specifically for higher education bodies.

   [46]The government has set out our monitoring role under the Counter
   Terrorism and Security Act 2015.

What do providers have to do?

   To comply with the Prevent duty, providers need to:
     * assess the risks associated with Prevent and draw up a plan to
       mitigate these
     * have effective welfare support systems, linking to DfE Prevent
       coordinators, local authorities or the police if necessary
     * have systems for assessing and mitigating risks around external
       speakers and events on campus, while maintaining the existing duty
       to promote freedom of speech
     * arrange ongoing Prevent training for relevant staff
     * have an IT usage policy, and where appropriate a research policy,
       which cover the Prevent duty
     * engage with students and ensure that students' unions and societies
       are aware of policies concerning activities on campus.

Does Prevent apply to my organisation?

   The Prevent duty applies to the governing bodies or proprietors of
   ‘relevant higher education bodies’ (RHEBs).

   Under the OfS, RHEBs are defined as:
     * providers that are registered with the OfS
     * providers that are not registered but have more than 250 higher
       education students - we define higher education students as those
       studying on a course that leads to a recognised higher education
       award in Schedule 6 of the Education Reform Act (1988)
     * providers that are designated for student support (e.g. for the
       purposes of ‘teach out’)
     * all the autonomous colleges, schools and halls of the Universities
       of Cambridge, Durham and Oxford.

Further education colleges

   Ofsted, rather than the OfS, is responsible for monitoring the
   implementation of the Prevent duty by further education or sixth-form
   colleges.

   ket-exemption-for-stamp-duty-and-stamp-duty-reserve-tax

Who is likely to be affected

   Recognised growth markets, persons purchasing UK securities traded on
   recognised growth markets and companies seeking to admit their shares
   to trading on recognised growth markets.

General description of the measure

   This measure increases access to the growth market exemption, which
   relieves trades made on a ‘recognised growth market’ from Stamp Duty
   and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (collectively, Stamp Taxes on Shares). The
   measure allows those Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulated
   multilateral trading facilities (MTFs), run by investment firms, that
   are approved as ‘recognised growth markets’ by HMRC to access the
   growth market exemption without needing to be recognised stock
   exchanges.

   This measure updates the market capitalisation condition for qualifying
   as a recognised growth market for the purposes of the exemption, by
   increasing the level up to which a majority of companies listed on the
   exchange can be capitalised from £170 million to £450 million.

Policy objective

   This measure seeks to ensure fairness in the current application of the
   growth market exemption, increase competition in the market leading to
   greater choice for small and medium enterprises seeking to access
   finance and updates the conditions attached to the growth market
   exemption to reflect the modern market.

Background to the measure

   This measure was announced at Autumn Statement 2023 and will be
   legislated for in Autumn Finance Bill 2023.

Detailed proposal

Operative date

   This measure will have effect on and after 1 January 2024.

Current law

   Current law is contained in section 99A Finance Act 1986.

Proposed revisions

   Legislation will be introduced in Autumn Finance Bill 2023 to amend the
   conditions to qualify for recognition as a growth market in section 99A
   Finance Act 1986.

Summary of impacts

Exchequer impact (£ million)

   2023 to 2024 2024 to 2025 2025 to 2026 2026 to 2027 2027 to 2028 2028
   to 2029
   Negligible Negligible Negligible Negligible Negligible Negligible

   This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on the Exchequer.

Economic impact

   This measure is not expected to have any significant economic impacts.

Impact on individuals, households and families

   This measure will impact on any individuals that purchase securities on
   any MTF run by an investment firm that applies, qualifies for and is
   approved for the growth market exemption by removing the 0.5% cost of
   Stamp Taxes on Shares per securities transaction. Individuals will not
   need to do anything as the exemption is automatically applied when the
   purchase is made.

   This measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability
   or breakdown.

   Customer experience is expected to remain broadly the same as the
   change does not affect any current processes or tax admin obligations
   for individuals.

Equalities impacts

   It is not anticipated that there will be impacts on those in groups
   sharing protected characteristics.

Impact on business including civil society organisations

   This measure is not expected to impact businesses or civil society
   organisations as it is anticipated that businesses who decide where to
   list their shares for trading, would consider the various benefits or
   the various markets that they could qualify for (for example, one of
   those factors might be whether the market offers the growth market
   exemption). It is expected that markets would advertise this rather
   than businesses having to find out for themselves via this measure,
   given it would be one of their selling points to get businesses to list
   with them rather than competitor markets.

   The increase in companies market capitalisation level should allow
   companies that are over the previous £170 million but under the new
   level more choice in terms of whether they position themselves on a
   recognised growth market and access the growth market exemption or
   whether they look to list on a main market and opt for the benefits
   that come with that.

   This measure is expected overall to have no impact on business’
   experience of dealing with HMRC, as the change does not change any
   processes or tax admin obligations.

   This measure is not expected to impact civil society organisations.

Operational impact (£ million) (HMRC or other)

   There is no operational impact for HMRC. Systems to approve
   applications for recognised growth market status are already in place
   and we do not expect high numbers of additional applications. The
   current arrangements for recognised growth market compliance will
   continue to apply.

Other impacts

   Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified.

Monitoring and evaluation

   This measure will be monitored using existing processes for the growth
   market exemption.

   If you have any questions about this change, please contact the HMRC
   Stamp Taxes Team by email:

Consumer Duty sets higher standards for financial services customers

   News stories First published: 31/07/2023 Last updated: 08/09/2023
   [121]See all updates

   The Duty sets higher standards of consumer protection. Find out what
   this means for you and what you should do if your provider isn’t
   meeting these standards.

   On 31 July, new rules came into force for financial services firms.

   The new rules, known as the Consumer Duty, set a higher standard of
   consumer protection in financial services.

   The Duty means you should get:
     * the support you need, when you need it
     * communications you understand
     * products and services that meet your needs and offer fair value

   We’re closely monitoring how firms are putting our new rules in place
   and will take action against those that aren’t following them.

What the Duty means for you

   Under the Duty, firms should be open and honest, avoid causing
   foreseeable harm, and support you to pursue your financial goals. You
   should expect:
     * helpful and accessible customer support, so it's as easy to sort
       out a problem, switch or cancel your product, as it was to buy it
       in the first place
     * timely and clear information you can understand, so you can make
       good financial decisions. This means important information
       shouldn’t be buried in lengthy terms and conditions
     * providers to offer products and services that are right for you,
       rather than pushing products and services you don’t need
     * products and services to provide fair value. This should mean you
       won’t be ripped off or have to pay costs you didn’t expect. But
       while your provider should offer you a fair price, it doesn't mean
       it will be the best deal for you, so you should still shop around
     * firms to consider if you’re in a vulnerable situation when dealing
       with you. This could be due to poor health or financial troubles,
       for instance

   These rules apply to all new and existing products and services that
   are currently on sale. For older products that are no longer on sale,
   the rules will apply from 31 July 2024.

What to do if you have a problem with your provider

   If you have a problem with your provider, or you don’t feel they’re
   meeting the Duty's standards, you should complain to them. If you're
   unhappy with their response, then you should contact the [122]Financial
   Ombudsman Service.

   If you don’t think you are getting good service or value for money you
   should shop around and consider switching.

   Find out more about [123]your rights with financial
   services and [124]how to complain.

Manner of acquisitions

   Examples of property acquisition in which ad valorem stamp duty (i.e.
   BSD, ABSD and SSD, whichever applicable) is payable:
    1. By way of purchase e.g. acceptance to option to purchase, sale and
       purchase agreement
    2. By way of gift including a voluntary declaration of trust and
       settlement
          + Declaration of Trust / Trust Deed:
               o A fixed duty of $10 is payable on the Declaration of
                 Trust/Trust deed which does not result in a change in
                 beneficial interest in the property.
               o Where there is a change in beneficial interest in the
                 property, ad valorem stamp duty will be payable on the
                 Declaration of Trust / Trust Deed.
    3. By way of distribution in specie upon the winding up of a company*
    4. By way of distribution from the estate of a deceased that is not in
       accordance to the Will, Intestate Succession Act or Muslim Law of
       Inheritance.
    5. By way of resulting trust pursuant to a renunciation of interest in
       residential property held under a bare trust

   *ABSD is applicable on transfer of interest in a residential property
   on or after 13 Oct 2023 which is distributed in specie to a shareholder
   of a company in connection with a liquidation of the company.
   [645]

Renunciation of interest in trust over residential property by beneficial
owner (Section 22C)

   Where any beneficiary renounces his interest in a residential property
   that is transferred to be held on bare trust on or after 10 May 2022,
   the settlor will need to pay stamp duty i.e. BSD and ABSD on the
   transfer of the share of the residential property back to him, under
   Section 22C of the Stamp Duties Act.
   You can refer to [646]Renunciation of Interest in Trust over
   residential property by Beneficial Owner (Section 22C) for more
   information.
   Example: A settlor sets up a trust where a residential property is held
   on bare trust for a sole identifiable beneficiary. The beneficiary
   later renounces his interest in the property, and a resulting trust is
   formed in favour of the settlor. The settlor is required to pay BSD and
   ABSD (based on the settlor’s profile) on the transfer of the
   residential property back to him.

Requirement to pay BSD

   You are required to pay BSD for documents executed for the transfer or
   sale and purchase of property located in Singapore. BSD will
   be computed on the purchase price as stated in the document to be
   stamped or market value of the property (whichever is the higher
   amount).

   If there is a benefit associated with the acquisition, and the benefit
   is stated in the document to be stamped and is a cash discount (i.e.
   cash, non-post dated cashier's order or cheque) to be given to the
   purchaser upon execution of the document (and not later), the amount of
   discount may be deducted from the purchase price to determine the
   consideration for stamp duty purpose. This is provided that the nett
   price is still reflective of market value.

   If the document to be stamped stated a non-cash benefit to be given
   (e.g. furniture voucher, rental guarantee, car or lucky draw), the
   value of benefit is not deductible from the purchase price for stamp
   duty purpose.

   If the cash or non- cash benefit is not stated in the document to be
   stamped, the value of the benefit is also not deductible from the
   purchase price for stamp duty purpose.

   The first instrument executed relating to a sale and purchase is liable
   to ad valorem duty (i.e. full duty). Subsequent document(s) relating to
   the same sale transaction are not liable to stamp duty.

Acquisition of property through an en-bloc purchase or “block” purchase

   Where multiple properties are acquired collectively, stamp duty will be
   calculated on the total purchase price of the multiple properties if:
    1. There is a single contract for the purchase of the multiple
       properties; or
    2. The purchases of the multiple properties are dependent and
       conditional on one another.

Stamp duty on a single contract for multiple properties

   Where there is a single contract for the purchase of multiple
   properties followed by individual documents for the purchase of each
   property, the single contract should be stamped at ad valorem duty
   based on the total purchase price.

Stamp duty on multiple documents

   Where there are multiple documents (with purchases which are dependent
   and conditional on one another), only one of the documents is required
   to be stamped at ad valorem duty, based on the total purchase price of
   all the related properties.

Rates and computation

   BSD^ is computed based on the purchase price or market value of the
   property, whichever is higher.

   Prior to 20 Feb 2018, the BSD rate was up to 3%. With effect from 20
   Feb 2018, there are differentiated BSD rates between residential and
   non-residential properties. The BSD rate for acquisition of residential
   properties from 20 Feb 2018 to 14 Feb 2023 is up to 4%. From 15 Feb
   2023, the top marginal rate for residential properties is 6%, and the
   top marginal rate for non-residential properties is 5%.

   For definition of residential or non-residential properties,

   The BSD rates are as follows:
   On or after 15 Feb 2023
   Purchase price or market value of the property BSD rates for
   residential properties BSD rates for non-residential properties
   First $180,000 1% 1%
   Next $180,000 2% 2%
   Next $640,000 3% 3%
   Next $500,000 4% 4%
   Next $1,500,000 5% 5%
   Remaining amount 6%
   ^BSD is rounded down to the nearest dollar, subject to a minimum duty
   of $1.

Examples

   Example 1: A terrace house was purchased on 17 Feb 2023 at $4,500,100
   which is reflective of the market value
    Market Value of the Property BSD Rate   Calculation
    First $180,000 1%   = $1,800 (1% x $180,000)
    Next $180,000   2%  = $3,600 (2% x $180,000)
    Next $640,000  3%  = $19,200 (3% x $640,000)
   Next $500,000 4% =  $20,000 (4% x $500,000)
   Next $1,500,000 5% = $75,000 (5% x $1,500,000)
   Remaining $1,500,100  6%  = $90,006 (6% x $1,500,100)
    BSD Payable    = $209,606 ($1,800 + $3,600 + $19,200 + $20,000 +
   $75,000 + $90,006)

   Example 2: A vacant land zoned “Commercial and Residential” was
   purchased on 1 Mar 2023 at $22,000,000 which is reflective of the
   market value

   Since the land is zoned “Commercial and Residential”, 60% and 40% of
   the gross floor area of the property is deemed attributable for
   residential and non-residential purposes respectively. BSD rates for
   residential and non-residential properties apply on the respective
   component.

   Value of 60% of the GFA deemed attributable for residential purposes =
   $9,000,000*

   Value of 40% of the GFA deemed attributable for commercial purposes =
   $13,000,000*

   *Valued and determined by a professional valuer.

   The BSD payable is:
   Market value of the Property BSD rate Calculation
   For the residential component
   First $180,000 1% = $1,800 (1% x $180,000)
   Next $180,000 2% = $3,600 (2% x $180,000)
   Next $640,000 3% = $19,200 (3% x $640,000)
   Next $500,000 4% = $20,000 (4% x $500,000)
   Next $1,500,000 5% = $75,000 (5% x $1,500,000)
   Remaining $6,000,000 6% = $360,000 (6% x $6,000,000)
   BSD for the residential component = $479,600 ($1,800 + $3,600 + $19,200
   + $20,000 + $75,000 + $360,000)
   For the non-residential component
   First $180,000 1% = $1,800 (1% x $180,000)
   Next $180,000 2% = $3,600 (2% x $180,000)
   Next $640,000 3% = $19,200 (3% x $640,000)
   Next $500,000 4% = $20,000 (4% x $500,000)
   Remaining $11,500,000 5% = $575,000 (5% x $11,500,000)
   BSD for the non-residential component = $619,600 ($1,800 + $3,600 +
   $19,200 + $20,000 + $575,000)
   BSD payable = $1,099,200 ($497,600 + $619,600)

       the case may be) must be developed/ used for non-residential
       purposes;
    2. Not to develop and/ or use X% of GFA of the subject property for
       residential purposes;
    3. Notify the IRAS immediately should any of the X% of GFA of the

       residential purposes;
    4. Submit the following documents to IRAS within 14 days from the date
       of the acquisition:
         1. Technical Condition of Tender for the Government Land Sales

            undertaking;
    5. Pay to the COSD as a debt due to the Singapore Government an amount
       equal to the BSD remitted with immediate effect from the earlier of
       the following:
         1. The date that any of the X% of GFA of the subject property is
            used for residential purposes; or
         2. The date that regulatory approval (e.g. WP) is granted for the
            development of residential units; and
    6. Pay the amount recoverable by the COSD under condition (e) at the

FAQS

   [649]

I am a Singapore Citizen buying my first property. Do I need to pay BSD?

   Yes, your purchase is subject to BSD. BSD is payable on all
   acquisitions of immovable properties in Singapore. It is not dependent
   on the nationality of the buyer or the number of properties that the
   buyer owns.
   [650]

I am buying an HDB flat. Do I need to pay BSD?

   Yes, BSD is payable upon the acquisition of any immovable property or
   land in Singapore, regardless of whether it is a private property or an
   HDB flat.
   [651]

I am buying an HDB shop with living quarters. Is my purchase subject to BSD
rates for non-residential property?

   No, as this is a property where one of the permitted uses is for
   residential use, the BSD rates for residential and non-residential
   properties would apply on the value attributable to the respective
   components.
   [652]

I am buying a semi-detached house with land zoned “Residential”. The
semi-detached house has been approved as a child care centre. Is my purchase
subject to BSD rates for non-residential property?

   No, as this is an acquisition of the building and land, the applicable
   BSD rates would depend on the zoning of the land. Since the land is
   zoned “Residential”, BSD rates for residential property applies.
   [653]

I am buying the upper floors of a shophouse which have been approved as a
child care centre for 3 years. Upon expiry of the approval, the use will
automatically revert to residential use. Is my purchase subject to BSD rates
for non-residential property?

   No, the BSD rates for residential properties will apply as this is a
   residential property and the use as a child care centre is only a
   temporary permitted use.
   [654]

I am buying the upper floors of a shophouse which have been permitted for
restaurant use by a Written Permission given under section 14(4) of the
Planning Act for a period exceeding 10 years. Is my purchase subject to BSD
rates for non-residential property?

   Yes, the BSD rates for non-residential property will apply since the
   properties acquired are permitted for non-residential use.
   [655]

I am buying a land zoned “Commercial &amp; Residential”. What is the market value
attributable to the residential and non-residential component?

   For a land zoned “Commercial &amp; Residential”, 60% GFA of the land is
   deemed attributable for residential purpose and the remainder is deemed
   attributable for non-residential purpose. You may get a professional
   valuer to value the part of the property attributable to residential
   and non-residential purposes.
   [656]

Can the contracting parties change the date of instrument to avoid paying
higher duty?

   No. The Commissioner of Stamp Duties takes a serious view of any
   attempt to evade or reduce the incidence of duties. Evasion of duties
   is an offence under section 62 of the Stamp Duties Act. Any person
   guilty of such an offence shall be liable on conviction to a fine of up
   to $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term of up to 3 years or to both.
   The Commissioner of Stamp Duties may also disregard or vary any
   arrangements meant to evade or reduce the incidence of duty, and impose
   the duty (including late stamping penalties, if applicable) which would
   otherwise be payable.
   [657]

Can I pay BSD using my Central Provident Fund (CPF) money?

   Using CPF funds to pay stamp duty is subject to the terms and
   conditions under the Private Properties and Public Housing Schemes. You
   may wish to check with CPF Board for more details.
   [658]

Do I need to pay the ABSD if I have paid the BSD?

   ABSD remains payable in addition to the BSD by buyers of certain
   profiles. For more information on ABSD, please refer to our webpage
   on [659]ABSD.
   [660]

I executed a contract to acquire a land zoned “White”. Its allowable use
includes residential but I would like to develop a 100% non-residential
development instead. Is the BSD payable calculated based on the BSD rates for
non-residential properties?

   As 100% GFA of the land is deemed attributable for residential purpose,
   the BSD payable would be calculated using the BSD rates for residential
   properties on the full purchase price or market value, whichever the
   higher. The BSD has to be paid within 14 days from the date of
   execution of the instrument.

   However, since you are constructing a 100% non-residential development,
   remission may be applicable. Please refer to part B of the remission
   section mentioned above, i.e. BSD remission for acquisition of
   residential land without use restriction for 100% non-residential
   development.

Stamp duty when buying a vehicle

   Calculate how much stamp duty you'll pay if you are buying a new or
   used vehicle. Exemptions apply to eligible pensioners and some vehicle
   types.
   On this page

What is stamp duty?

   Stamp duty is charged when registration is issued to a different person
   or corporation. The tax is collected by Transport for NSW on behalf of
   Revenue NSW.

   To calculate stamp duty, you need the vehicle's market value or how
   much you paid for it (whichever is higher).

     __________________________________________________________________

     * registering or transferring registration on a caravan or camper
       trailer
     * an [76]eligible DVA pensioner
     * registering a new heavy trailer with a Gross Vehicle Mass of more

Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD)

   The Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD) can help you pay for
   education and training programs. If you’ve served at least 2 years on
   active duty, find out if you qualify for the MGIB-AD program.

Am I eligible for education benefits through the MGIB-AD program?

   You may be eligible for education benefits through this program if you
   were honorably discharged and you meet the requirements of one of these
   categories.

One of these categories must describe you

Category I

   All of these are true:
     * You have a high school diploma, GED, or 12 hours of college credit,
       and
     * You entered active duty for the first time after June 30, 1985, and
     * You had your military pay reduced by $100 a month for the first 12
       months of service

   And you’ve served continuously (without a break) for at least one of
   these time periods:
     * 3 years, or
     * 2 years if that was your agreement when you enlisted, or
     * 4 years if you entered the Selected Reserve within a year of
       leaving active duty (called the 2 by 4 program)

Category II

   All of these are true:
     * You have a high school diploma, GED, or 12 hours of college credit,
       and
     * You entered active duty before January 1, 1977 (or before January
       2, 1978, under a delayed enlistment program contracted before
       January 1, 1977), and
     * You served at least 1 day between October 19, 1984, and June 30,
       1985, and stayed on active duty through June 30, 1988 (or through
       June 30, 1987, if you entered the Selected Reserve within 1 year of
       leaving active duty and served 4 years), and
     * You had at least 1 day of entitlement left under the Vietnam Era GI
       Bill (Chapter 34) as of December 31, 1989

Category III

   All of these are true:
     * You have a high school diploma, GED, or 12 hours of college credit,
       and
     * You don’t qualify for MGIB under categories I or II, and
     * You had your military pay reduced by $1,200 before separation

   And one of these is true:
     * You were on active duty on September 30, 1990, and involuntarily
       separated (not by your choice) after February 2, 1991, or
     * You involuntarily separated on or after November 30, 1993, or
     * You chose to voluntarily separate under either the Voluntary
       Separation Incentive (VSI) program or the Special Separation
       Benefit (SSB) program

Category IV

   Both of these are true:
     * You have a high school diploma, GED, or 12 hours of college credit,
       and
     * You had military pay reduced by $100 a month for 12 months or made
       a $1,200 lump-sum contribution (meaning you paid it all at once)

   And one of these is true:
     * You were on active duty on October 9, 1996, had money left in a
       VEAP account on that date, and chose MGIB before October 9, 1997,
       or
     * You entered full-time National Guard duty under title 32, USC,
       between July 1, 1985, and November 28, 1989, and chose MGIB between
       October 9, 1996, and July 9, 1997

How does VA determine how much money I’ll receive?

   The amount you’ll receive depends on these factors:
     * Your length of service, and
     * The type of education or training program you choose, and
     * Your category (I, II, III, or IV), and
     * Whether you qualify for a college fund or kicker, and
     * How much you’ve paid into the $600 Buy-Up program
       [30]Learn more about the $600 Buy-Up program

   Note: You usually have 10 years to use your MGIB-AD benefits. This may
   change depending on your situation.

How do I get these benefits?

   Follow the steps here to apply for these benefits.
    1. Make sure we’ve approved your program
       Before you enroll, contact the school or use the GI Bill Comparison
       Tool to find out if we’ve approved your program for VA education
       benefits. If you have questions, call us at
       [32]888-442-4551 ([33]TTY: 711). We’re here Monday through Friday,
       8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET. Or submit a question online through Ask
       VA.
       [34]Use the GI Bill Comparison Tool
       [35]Contact us online through Ask VA
       Note: If you want to enroll in a program that we haven’t approved,
       you’ll need to ask the school to request approval. We can’t take
       any action until an official from your school (not you) requests
       approval. If we don’t approve your program, you’ll have to pay all
       costs at the school, including tuition and fees.
    2. Apply for benefits
       You can submit your Application for VA Benefits (VA Form 22-1990)
       online.
       [36]Apply online now
       You can also apply by mail, in person, or with the help of a
       trained professional.
       [37]Learn more about other ways to apply
    3. Ask your school or training program to certify your enrollment
       The certifying official may be someone in your school’s financial
       aid, Veterans Affairs, registrar, admissions, or counseling office.
       For on-the-job training or an apprenticeship, the official may be
       someone in your school’s training, finance, or human resources
       office.
       Note: You’ll then need to verify your enrollment at the end of each
       month to keep receiving payments. You can verify your enrollment
       online through our Web Automated Verification system (called
       “WAVE”) or by phone by calling [38]877-823-2378 ([39]TTY: 711).

How can I use my MGIB-AD education benefits?

   You can use your GI Bill benefits in many ways to advance your
   education and training.
   [42]Find out how to use your GI Bill benefits

   In some cases, we may help you pay for:
     * Remedial courses (classes some students must take to build up their
       basic skills in math, reading, or English before they can take
       regular college courses)
     * Deficiency courses (classes some students must take in order to be
       admitted to a certain college)
     * Refresher courses (brief courses that help people review and
       improve their knowledge in a certain subject area)

What if I qualify for other VA education benefits too?

   You can use only 1 education benefit for a period of service. You’ll
   have to choose which education benefit you’d like to use.
   [43]Compare VA education benefits
   Once you choose an education benefit, you can’t change your mind and
   use a different education benefit.

   If you choose to use the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) instead of the
   Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD or Chapter 30), you can’t
   switch at some later date to use MGIB-AD. If you decide to use the
   Post-9/11 GI Bill, we’ll refund you part or all of the payments you
   made into MGIB-AD.

   [44]Learn more about Montgomery GI Bill refunds

   If you have only 1 period of service that begins on or after August 1,
   2011, and you start receiving payments for MGIB-AD, you may lose your
   eligibility for the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

   You can also get help deciding which education benefits to use by
   calling us at [45]888-442-4551 ([46]TTY: 711). We’re here Monday
   through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET.

How many total months of VA education benefits can I get?

   You may be able to get a maximum of 48 months of VA education
   benefits—not including Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&amp;E)
   benefits. But many applicants are eligible for only 36 months.

How can I get more information?

   You can get more information about the GI Bill from these guides:

   UNDERSTANDING THE WTO: THE AGREEMENTS

Anti-dumping, subsidies, safeguards: contingencies, etc

   Binding tariffs, and applying them equally to all trading partners
   (most-favoured-nation treatment, or MFN) are key to the smooth flow of
   trade in goods. The WTO agreements uphold the principles, but they also
   allow exceptions in some circumstances. Three of these issues are:

   [redbulle.gif] actions taken against dumping (selling at an unfairly
   low price)
   [redbulle.gif] subsidies and special countervailing duties to offset
   the subsidies
   [redbulle.gif] emergency measures to limit imports temporarily,
   designed to safeguard domestic industries.

Anti-dumping actions

   If a company exports a product at a price lower than the price it
   normally charges on its own home market, it is said to be dumping the
   product. Is this unfair competition? Opinions differ, but many
   governments take action against dumping in order to defend their
   domestic industries. The WTO agreement does not pass judgement. Its
   focus is on how governments can or cannot react to dumping it
   disciplines anti-dumping actions, and it is often called the
   Anti-Dumping Agreement. (This focus only on the reaction to dumping
   contrasts with the approach of the Subsidies and Countervailing
   Measures Agreement.)

   The legal definitions are more precise, but broadly speaking the WTO
   agreement allows governments to act against dumping where there is
   genuine (material) injury to the competing domestic industry. In order
   to do that the government has to be able to show that dumping is taking
   place, calculate the extent of dumping (how much lower the export price
   is compared to the exporters home market price), and show that the
   dumping is causing injury or threatening to do so.

   GATT (Article 6) allows countries to take action against dumping. The
   Anti-Dumping Agreement clarifies and expands Article 6, and the two
   operate together. They allow countries to act in a way that would
   normally break the GATT principles of [21]binding a tariff and [22]not
   discriminating between trading partners typically anti-dumping action
   means charging extra import duty on the particular product from the
   particular exporting country in order to bring its price closer to the
   normal value or to remove the injury to domestic industry in the
   importing country.

   There are many different ways of calculating whether a particular
   product is being dumped heavily or only lightly. The agreement narrows
   down the range of possible options. It provides three methods to
   calculate a products normal value. The main one is based on the price
   in the exporters domestic market. When this cannot be used, two
   alternatives are available the price charged by the exporter in another
   country, or a calculation based on the combination of the exporters
   production costs, other expenses and normal profit margins. And the
   agreement also specifies how a fair comparison can be made between the
   export price and what would be a normal price.

   Calculating the extent of dumping on a product is not enough.
   Anti-dumping measures can only be applied if the dumping is hurting the
   industry in the importing country. Therefore, a detailed investigation
   has to be conducted according to specified rules first. The
   investigation must evaluate all relevant economic factors that have a
   bearing on the state of the industry in question. If the investigation
   shows dumping is taking place and domestic industry is being hurt, the
   exporting company can undertake to raise its price to an agreed level
   in order to avoid anti-dumping import duty.

   Detailed procedures are set out on how anti-dumping cases are to be
   initiated, how the investigations are to be conducted, and the
   conditions for ensuring that all interested parties are given an
   opportunity to present evidence. Anti-dumping measures must expire five
   years after the date of imposition, unless an investigation shows that
   ending the measure would lead to injury.

   Anti-dumping investigations are to end immediately in cases where the
   authorities determine that the margin of dumping is insignificantly
   small (defined as less than 2% of the export price of the product).
   Other conditions are also set. For example, the investigations also
   have to end if the volume of dumped imports is negligible (i.e. if the
   volume from one country is less than 3% of total imports of that
   product although investigations can proceed if several countries, each
   supplying less than 3% of the imports, together account for 7% or more
   of total imports).

   The agreement says member countries must inform the Committee on
   Anti-Dumping Practices about all preliminary and final anti-dumping
   actions, promptly and in detail. They must also report on all
   investigations twice a year. When differences arise, members are
   encouraged to consult each other. They can also use the WTOs dispute
   settlement procedure.

   Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994

Subsidies and countervailing measures

   This agreement does two things: it disciplines the use of subsidies,
   and it regulates the actions countries can take to counter the effects
   of subsidies. It says a country can use the WTOs [29]dispute settlement
   procedure to seek the withdrawal of the subsidy or the removal of its
   adverse effects. Or the country can launch its own investigation and
   ultimately charge extra duty (known as countervailing duty) on
   subsidized imports that are found to be hurting domestic producers.

   The agreement contains a definition of subsidy. It also introduces the
   concept of a specific subsidy i.e. a subsidy available only to an
   enterprise, industry, group of enterprises, or group of industries in
   the country (or state, etc) that gives the subsidy. The disciplines set
   out in the agreement only apply to specific subsidies. They can be
   domestic or export subsidies.

   The agreement defines two categories of subsidies: prohibited and
   actionable. It originally contained a third category: non-actionable
   subsidies. This category existed for five years, ending on 31 December
   1999, and was not extended. The agreement applies to agricultural goods
   as well as industrial products, except when the subsidies are exempt
   under the Agriculture Agreements peace clause, due to expire at the end
   of 2003.

   [redbulle.gif] Prohibited subsidies: subsidies that require recipients
   to meet certain export targets, or to use domestic goods instead of
   imported goods. They are prohibited because they are specifically
   designed to distort international trade, and are therefore likely to
   hurt other countries trade. They can be challenged in the WTO dispute
   settlement procedure where they are handled under an accelerated
   timetable. If the dispute settlement procedure confirms that the
   subsidy is prohibited, it must be withdrawn immediately. Otherwise, the
   complaining country can take counter measures. If domestic producers
   are hurt by imports of subsidized products, countervailing duty can be
   imposed.

   [redbulle.gif] Actionable subsidies: in this category the complaining
   country has to show that the subsidy has an adverse effect on its
   interests. Otherwise the subsidy is permitted. The agreement defines
   three types of damage they can cause. One countrys subsidies can hurt a
   domestic industry in an importing country. They can hurt rival
   exporters from another country when the two compete in third markets.
   And domestic subsidies in one country can hurt exporters trying to
   compete in the subsidizing countrys domestic market. If the Dispute
   Settlement Body rules that the subsidy does have an adverse effect, the
   subsidy must be withdrawn or its adverse effect must be removed. Again,
   if domestic producers are hurt by imports of subsidized products,
   countervailing duty can be imposed.

   Some of the disciplines are similar to those of the Anti-Dumping
   Agreement. Countervailing duty (the parallel of anti-dumping duty) can
   only be charged after the importing country has conducted a detailed
   investigation similar to that required for anti-dumping action. There
   are detailed rules for deciding whether a product is being subsidized
   (not always an easy calculation), criteria for determining whether
   imports of subsidized products are hurting (causing injury to) domestic
   industry, procedures for initiating and conducting investigations, and
   rules on the implementation and duration (normally five years) of
   countervailing measures. The subsidized exporter can also agree to
   raise its export prices as an alternative to its exports being charged
   countervailing duty.

   Subsidies may play an important role in developing countries and in the
   transformation of centrally-planned economies to market economies.
   Least-developed countries and developing countries with less than
   $1,000 per capita GNP are exempted from disciplines on prohibited
   export subsidies. Other developing countries are given until 2003 to
   get rid of their export subsidies. Least-developed countries must
   eliminate import-substitution subsidies (i.e. subsidies designed to
   help domestic production and avoid importing) by 2003 for other
   developing countries the deadline was 2000. Developing countries also
   receive preferential treatment if their exports are subject to
   countervailing duty investigations. For transition economies,
   prohibited subsidies had to be phased out by 2002.

Safeguards: emergency protection from imports

   A WTO member may restrict imports of a product temporarily (take
   safeguard actions) if its domestic industry is injured or threatened
   with injury caused by a surge in imports. Here, the injury has to be
   serious. Safeguard measures were always available under GATT (Article
   19). However, they were infrequently used, some governments preferring
   to protect their domestic industries through grey area measures using
   bilateral negotiations outside GATTs auspices, they persuaded exporting
   countries to restrain exports voluntarily or to agree to other means of
   sharing markets. Agreements of this kind were reached for a wide range
   of products: automobiles, steel, and semiconductors, for example.

   The WTO agreement broke new ground. It prohibits grey-area measures,
   and it sets time limits (a sunset clause) on all safeguard actions. The
   agreement says members must not seek, take or maintain any voluntary
   export restraints, orderly marketing arrangements or any other similar
   measures on the export or the import side. The bilateral measures that
   were not modified to conform with the agreement were phased out at the
   end of 1998. Countries were allowed to keep one of these measures an
   extra year (until the end of 1999), but only the European Union for
   restrictions on imports of cars from Japan made use of this provision.

   An import surge justifying safeguard action can be a real increase in
   imports (an absolute increase); or it can be an increase in the imports
   share of a shrinking market, even if the import quantity has not
   increased (relative increase).

   Industries or companies may request safeguard action by their
   government. The WTO agreement sets out requirements for safeguard
   investigations by national authorities. The emphasis is on transparency
   and on following established rules and practices avoiding arbitrary
   methods. The authorities conducting investigations have to announce
   publicly when hearings are to take place and provide other appropriate
   means for interested parties to present evidence. The evidence must
   include arguments on whether a measure is in the public interest.

   The agreement sets out criteria for assessing whether serious injury is
   being caused or threatened, and the factors which must be considered in
   determining the impact of imports on the domestic industry. When
   imposed, a safeguard measure should be applied only to the extent
   necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to help the industry
   concerned to adjust. Where quantitative restrictions (quotas) are
   imposed, they normally should not reduce the quantities of imports
   below the annual average for the last three representative years for
   which statistics are available, unless clear justification is given
   that a different level is necessary to prevent or remedy serious
   injury.

   In principle, safeguard measures cannot be targeted at imports from a
   particular country. However, the agreement does describe how quotas can
   be allocated among supplying countries, including in the exceptional
   circumstance where imports from certain countries have increased
   disproportionately quickly. A safeguard measure should not last more
   than four years, although this can be extended up to eight years,
   subject to a determination by competent national authorities that the
   measure is needed and that there is evidence the industry is adjusting.
   Measures imposed for more than a year must be progressively
   liberalized.

   When a country restricts imports in order to safeguard its domestic
   producers, in principle it must give something in return. The agreement
   says the exporting country (or exporting countries) can seek
   compensation through consultations. If no agreement is reached the
   exporting country can retaliate by taking equivalent action for
   instance, it can raise tariffs on exports from the country that is
   enforcing the safeguard measure. In some circumstances, the exporting
   country has to wait for three years after the safeguard measure was
   introduced before it can retaliate in this way i.e. if the measure
   conforms with the provisions of the agreement and if it is taken as a
   result of an increase in the quantity of imports from the exporting
   country.

   To some extent developing countries exports are shielded from safeguard
   actions. An importing country can only apply a safeguard measure to a
   product from a developing country if the developing country is
   supplying more than 3% of the imports of that product, or if developing
   country members with less than 3% import share collectively account for
   more than 9% of total imports of the product concerned.

   The WTOs Safeguards Committee oversees the operation of the agreement
   and is responsible for the surveillance of members commitments.
   Governments have to report each phase of a safeguard investigation and
   related decision-making, and the committee reviews these reports.

   What is this agreement called?
   [34]Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures

   AD-CVD?

   People sometimes refer to the two together AD-CVD but there are
   fundamental differences

   Dumping and subsidies together with anti-dumping (AD) measures and
   countervailing duties (CVD) share a number of similarities. Many
   countries handle the two under a single law, apply a similar process to
   deal with them and give a single authority responsibility for
   investigations. Occasionally, the two WTO committees responsible for
   these issues meet jointly.

   The reaction to dumping and subsidies is often a special offsetting
   import tax (countervailing duty in the case of a subsidy). This is
   charged on products from specific countries and therefore it breaks the
   GATT principles of [35]binding a tariff and treating trading partners
   equally ([36]MFN). The agreements provide an escape clause, but they
   both also say that before imposing a duty, the importing country must
   conduct a detailed investigation that shows properly that domestic
   industry is hurt.

   But there are also fundamental differences, and these are reflected in
   the agreements.

   Dumping is an action by a company. With subsidies, it is the government
   or a government agency that acts, either by paying out subsidies
   directly or by requiring companies to subsidize certain customers.

   But the WTO is an organization of countries and their governments. The
   WTO does not deal with companies and cannot regulate companies actions
   such as dumping. Therefore the Anti-Dumping Agreement only concerns the
   actions governments may take against dumping. With subsidies,
   governments act on both sides: they subsidize and they act against each
   others subsidies. Therefore the subsidies agreement disciplines both
   the subsidies and the reactions.

   Public authorities who operate in England must consider what they can
   do to conserve and enhance biodiversity in England. This is the
   strengthened ‘biodiversity duty’ that the Environment Act 2021
   introduces.

   This means that, as a public authority, you must:
    1. Consider what you can do to conserve and enhance biodiversity.
    2. Agree policies and specific objectives based on your consideration.
    3. Act to deliver your policies and achieve your objectives.

Who must comply with the biodiversity duty

   You must meet the biodiversity duty if you are a public authority, such
   as a:
     * [52]government department or public body
     * local authority or local planning authority
     * statutory undertaker – a business that has public authority duties
       for their land and delivers something of public importance

When to meet your biodiversity duty

   You must complete your first consideration of what action to take for
   biodiversity by 1 January 2024. You must agree your policies and
   objectives as soon as possible after this.

   You must reconsider the actions you can take within 5 years of when you
   complete your previous consideration.

   You can decide to do this more often, for example, you could reconsider
   your actions quarterly, annually, or every 5 years.

Consider relevant strategies

   You must check if these strategies will affect how your organisation
   complies with the biodiversity duty:
     * [53]local nature recovery strategies
     * [54]species conservation strategies
     * [55]protected site strategies

   You must:
     * understand how/if they are relevant to your organisation
     * be aware of how these strategies affect land that you own or
       manage, or actions you could take to conserve and enhance
       biodiversity
     * consider how you could contribute to the strategy, where
       appropriate

Local nature recovery strategies

   These will be locally led strategies for nature and environmental
   improvement established by the Environment Act 2021. Each local nature
   recovery strategy will:
     * agree priorities for nature’s recovery
     * map the most valuable existing areas for nature
     * map specific proposals for creating or improving habitat for nature
       and wider environmental goals

   There will be around 50 local nature recovery strategies covering the
   whole of England with no gaps or overlaps.

   When the local nature recovery strategies are published, you will need
   to understand which ones are relevant to you and how you can contribute
   to them. These are likely to be the strategy, or strategies, for the
   areas in England you’re active in.

   Preparation of local nature recovery strategies is expected to begin
   across England from April 2023. You may want to consider how you could
   get involved in preparing and delivering them now. For example, you
   could contribute by acting on proposals to create or improve habitat on
   land you own or manage, or help someone else to do so. By including any
   positive actions you plan to take in the strategy, you can help improve
   their quality. It will also make it easier for you to show how you have
   fulfilled your duty.

   Guidance on how local planning authorities should consider local nature
   recovery strategies will be published when available.

Species conservation strategies

   Established by the Environment Act 2021, species conservation
   strategies aim to safeguard the future of the species that are at
   greatest risk. The strategies will find better ways to comply with
   existing legal obligations to protect species at risk and to improve
   their conservation status.

Protected site strategies

   Established by the Environment Act 2021, protected site strategies take
   a new approach to protecting and restoring species and habitats in
   protected sites. Protected site strategies will provide ways to
   overcome offsite pressures such as nutrient pollution in the wider
   catchment.

How your biodiversity duty helps achieve biodiversity goals and targets

   The action you take for biodiversity will contribute to the achievement
   of national goals and targets on biodiversity.

   The [56]Environmental Improvement Plan (EIP23), published in January
   2023, sets out government plans for significantly improving the natural
   environment.

   By 2030, the government has committed to:
     * halt the decline in species abundance
     * protect 30% of UK land

   By 2042, the government has committed to:
     * increase species abundance by at least 10% from 2030, surpassing
       2022 levels
     * restore or create at least 500,000 ha of a range of wildlife rich
       habitats
     * reduce the risk of species extinction
     * restore 75% of our one million hectares of terrestrial and
       freshwater protected sites to favourable condition, securing their
       wildlife value for the long term

Actions you could take

   The policies and objectives you set, and the action you take to achieve
   them, will depend on your functions as a public authority.

   Public authorities can give priority to areas of high biodiversity
   value, if appropriate.

   If you already have a strategy that monitors your environmental
   performance, you can include your biodiversity actions as part of this.

   Consider creating a new document if you do not have a suitable existing
   strategy. In it, you can record the actions you plan to take to meet
   your biodiversity objectives.

   As a core component of natural capital, biodiversity supports ecosystem
   services that benefit people and the economy. When thinking about what
   actions you could take as part of your duty, you could consider the
   value of taking a [57]Natural Capital approach.

   If your public authority is involved with development plans and
   decisions, consider your biodiversity duty when you’re complying with
   requirements under:
     * [58]strategic environmental assessment
     * [59]environmental impact assessment
     * [60]Habitats Regulations assessment

Manage land to improve biodiversity

   Consider how the land you manage could improve biodiversity. This
   includes green and blue spaces like:
     * allotments
     * cemeteries
     * parks and sports fields
     * amenity spaces and communal gardens
     * roadside and railway verges
     * field margins and hedgerows
     * rights of way and access routes
     * woodlands and nature reserves
     * canals and rivers
     * water-dependent habitats
     * estuaries and coastal habitats

   Small changes to how you manage these areas could create habitats for
   wildlife and ‘nature corridors’ that connect existing habitats. This
   allows species to move between habitats, maintain or increase
   populations and be more resilient to climate change.

   There are other things you can do to improve habitats, including:
     * using native and sustainably sourced trees when planting
     * [61]creating dedicated spaces for wildlife
     * leaving dead wood safely in place in woodlands to provide
       additional habitat
     * maintaining planted trees to give them the best chance of survival
     * reducing the use of herbicides, pesticides, peat and water
     * implementing measures to prevent the spread of invasive species and
       plant disease

   These actions can save money while delivering benefits to biodiversity.

   If you own or manage large areas of land, consider promoting and
   encouraging nature-based solutions, restoration of natural processes
   and landscape recovery.

   Natural England has published the [62]Green Infrastructure Framework -
   Principles and Standards for England. This includes planning, design
   and process guides.

Make space for wildlife

   You could create dedicated spaces to attract wildlife and enhance
   biodiversity. This is possible even if your public authority owns a
   single office building. It is important that these measures are
   appropriate to the location.

   You could:
     * build and install nest boxes for birds, bats and other animals
     * add green walls or roofs to existing or new buildings
     * plant native trees and shrubs
     * plant wildflowers for pollinators

   You can do more if you own or manage specific types of land. For
   example, if you own or manage:
     * school grounds – create gardens, ponds, meadows or woodlands to
       improve biodiversity and aid education
     * farmland – be aware of soil health, water use and waste management
       and encourage farmers to apply for agri-environment schemes and use
       pesticides appropriately.

   [63]Check the list of priority habitats and species in the UK.

Enhance protected sites

   Sites that public authorities own or manage can be protected by other
   legislation. For example:
     * [64]sites of special scientific interest
     * [65]special areas of conservation or special protection areas
     * [66]national nature reserves
     * local nature reserves and local sites
     * Ramsar sites (wetlands of international importance)

   You should already be helping to conserve and enhance biodiversity on
   this land. For example, public bodies already have a duty to take all
   reasonable steps to conserve and enhance sites of special scientific
   interest.

   The [67]Environmental Improvement Plan set the expectation that all
   public authorities should ensure they have management plans in place by
   the end of 2023 to support their sites to reach favourable status.

   Authorities should produce those plans and work actively with Natural
   England and others to identify and implement the actions needed to
   improve site condition.

Actions in national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty

   Consider designated areas such as national parks or areas of
   outstanding natural beauty (AONB) as part of your biodiversity duty.
   This is important if you have functions in or close to a site
   designated as a national park or AONB. Improving nature in national
   parks or AONBs is an action that can enhance and conserve biodiversity.
   If appropriate to your public body, you could comply with your
   biodiversity duty by:
     * helping to develop and implement management plans for national
       parks or AONBs
     * making improvements to nature in these areas

Improve how you manage buildings

   Review how you manage buildings and the land around them. This could
   include considering:
     * whether you should remove vegetation around your buildings and if
       you do, when to do it
     * what chemicals you use on the premises
     * when you carry out maintenance work, to minimise disturbance to
       wildlife
     * whether you can reduce the use of energy and water to help reduce
       pollution and address the pressure it puts on wildlife

Educate, advise and raise awareness

   You can help the public understand biodiversity and why it’s important
   to conserve and enhance it. This can encourage land managers,
   businesses and the general public to take action to benefit
   biodiversity too.

   For your policies, objectives and actions, you could:
     * include the public in projects to improve biodiversity
     * feature biodiversity in public or internal communications
     * use libraries and museums to raise awareness of biodiversity
     * put information boards in green spaces or offer guided walks
     * include biodiversity considerations in advice for internal and
       external clients and service users
     * educate your staff on your biodiversity actions and why they’re
       important
     * raise public awareness of how their gardens can support
       biodiversity, for example by avoiding artificial grass

Review internal policies and processes

   All public authorities have internal policies and processes for staff
   and facilities that could affect biodiversity.

   Changes to internal policies and processes that can affect biodiversity
   are another way you can meet your duty. Policies you could review
   include:
     * transport – support sustainable travel to reduce carbon emissions
       and improve air quality
     * waste – review waste management and recycling processes to reduce
       water pollution and air pollution from waste transport and landfill
     * water – improve water efficiency to reduce the effect water
       abstraction can have on sensitive habitats and species
     * procurement – buy sustainable materials and supplies to reduce the
       demand on natural resources
     * light – make sure the design of artificial lighting minimises
       effects on nature

Prepare for biodiversity net gain

   Biodiversity net gain (BNG) is an approach to development or land
   management that aims to leave the natural environment in a measurably
   better state than it was beforehand. If your public authority does not
   have a biodiversity net gain policy in the local plan, you could
   consider preparing one.

   Future development projects (apart from exempt developments) will need
   to achieve a 10% biodiversity net gain. This is expected to be required
   from:
     * November 2023 for Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (TCPA)
       projects not falling under the small sites definition [68][footnote
       1]
     * April 2024 for TCPA small sites
     * the end of 2025 for Planning Act 2008 (Nationally Significant
       Infrastructure Projects)

   Local planning authorities will need to report what is done for
   biodiversity net gain on and off development sites.

   Local planning authorities should consider areas that are appropriate
   for biodiversity net gain. Consider how existing planning advice and
   strategies can protect and enhance biodiversity.

   The developer is responsible for selecting the competent person for
   completing the small sites metric (SSM). The competent person does not
   need to be an ecologist for the SSM. The local planning authority does
   not need to verify the competent person.

   Find out about [69]biodiversity net gain and how it affects you.

Get help with your actions

   You can get help from experts when considering what actions you can
   take. For example, you could:
     * commission a survey or audit to help assess your property and its
       potential to improve biodiversity
     * consult your local nature recovery strategy to find out what
       actions would benefit your area – preparation of these will begin
       in 2023
     * check existing data about wildlife and habitats in the area
     * speak to Natural England, Environment Agency, Forestry Commission,
       local wildlife trusts or consultant ecologists

   You can get existing local data from [70]Local Environmental Record
   Centres. If you commission research, you can share that data with them.
   To help you understand habitats and species in your area, you can use
   the national [71]Magic Map.

   Getting expert advice can help you understand how you can make a
   difference for biodiversity and avoid unintended outcomes.

   You may need to get expert [72]environmental advice on planning before
   preparing plans or considering development proposals.

   Environmental assessment regulations require monitoring of the effects
   of development plans and projects. You could use the results of this
   monitoring as a source of environmental data.

Reporting your biodiversity policies and actions

   Some public authorities need to [73]publish a biodiversity report.

   Local authorities (excluding parish councils) and local planning
   authorities must write and publish a biodiversity report. Other public
   authorities must fulfil their duty, but do not need to publish a
   report.

   For local authorities and local planning authorities, the end date of
   your first reporting period should be no later than 1 January 2026.

   After this, the end date of each reporting period must be within 5
   years of the end date of the previous reporting period.

   The report is a chance to communicate how your organisation is helping
   to improve the environment and show the positive change you’re making.

   Defra intends to include references to your biodiversity reports in the
   5-yearly reviews of the Environmental Improvement Plan.

   Defra’s [74]reporting your biodiversity duty actions guidance gives
   information about when you must publish your report and what you need
   to include.

   Your biodiversity reports will:
     * help everyone understand how we are collectively meeting shared
       goals to conserve and enhance biodiversity
     * allow you to showcase the action you’re taking to improve
       biodiversity
     * show other authorities and the general public what they can do for
       nature recovery and share good practice

Footnotes

   1. For BNG exemptions, ‘small sites’ has 2 definitions.

   Residential small sites will have either:
     * 1 to 9 dwellings on sites of less than one hectare
     * an unknown number of dwellings on sites of less than 0.5 hectares

   Non-residential small sites will have either:
     * less than 1,000 square metres of floor space
     * a site area of less than one hectare

Guidance on the professional duty of candour

   Joint guidance with the General Medical Council on the duty of candour

Contents

     * Overview
     * [84]Read the professional duty of candour

   All healthcare professionals have a duty of candour – this is a
   professional responsibility to be honest when things go wrong.

   This [85]guidance on the professional duty of candour ([86]Cymraeg) was
   produced in collaboration with the General Medical Council and has been
   refreshed in March 2022.

   This guidance complements the joint statement on the professional duty
   of candour by professional healthcare regulators (October 2014) and
   section 14 of [87]the Code.

   It focuses not only on the duty to be open and honest with patients but
   also on the need to be open and honest within organisations in
   reporting adverse incidents or near misses that may have led to harm.

   Professionals, students and employers can find out more about the
   professional duty of candour and how to apply it in practice by
   watching our webinar which took place 25 April.

TARIC

   [81]TARIC, the integrated Tariff of the European Union, is a
   multilingual database integrating all measures relating to EU customs
   tariff, commercial and agricultural legislation.

   [82]ACCESS THE DATABASE

   Integrating and coding these measures facilitates their uniform
   application by all Member States and gives all economic operators a
   clear view of measures to be taken when importing goods into the EU or
   exporting goods from the EU.

   It also makes it possible to collect EU-wide statistics for the
   concerned measures.

   Daily transmissions of TARIC data via an electronic network guarantee
   immediate and correct information for the national administrations of
   the Member States, who use this data mainly to feed their national
   systems for customs clearance, with the goal of maximising automatic

duty

/ˈdudi/

/ˈduti/

   [10]IPA guide

   Other forms: duties

   When you've done your duty, you've done what you're supposed to and met
   your responsibilities. Your sense of duty as a citizen might compel you
   to vote; it might also keep you from voting twice.

   A duty is an obligation, and we get new duties with new positions in
   life, like taking a job, or becoming a parent. You didn't realize one
   of your duties as club president would be cleaning up after meetings. A
   police officer or cab driver can be on-duty or off-duty. As an off-duty
   police officer, you might still feel it's your duty to stop a robbery.
   Duty also means "tax," which is why people like shopping duty-free at
   the airport.

Trade Tariff: look up commodity codes, duty and VAT rates

   Use this service to find a commodity code for goods you’re importing to
   or exporting from the UK.

   You can also use the service to:
     * check if there’s duty or VAT to pay
     * find out about suspensions or reductions

   You’ll need a commodity code when you fill in a customs declaration
   form, so you pay the correct amount of tax and duties.

   [40]Start now

Before you start

   To find a commodity code for your goods, you’ll need details of the
   product you’re importing or exporting. This could include:
     * the type of product
     * what the product is used for
     * the materials used to make it
     * how it’s produced
     * the way it’s packaged

Help with finding the right commodity code

   If you’re not sure how to classify your goods, you can:
     * check the [41]guidance on hard to classify goods
     * use the [42]A to Z of classified goods to find commodity codes for
       common products

Reducing CO₂ emissions from heavy-duty vehicles

   Page contents
   (BUTTON)

   Lorries, buses and coaches are responsible for more than a quarter of
   GHG emissions from road transport in the EU, and for over 6% of total
   EU GHG emissions. Despite some improvements in fuel consumption
   efficiency in recent years, these emissions are still rising, mainly
   due to increasing road freight traffic.

   To fight the climate crisis, we need to bring down CO[2] emissions in
   this field. To do so, the Commission is proposing new targets which
   will raise our ambition and meet the EU’s climate and zero pollution
   objectives while [74]lowering demand for fossil fuels.

Raising our ambition

   In 2023, the Commission proposed a [75]revision of the Regulation on
   CO[2] emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles. If adopted, the
   proposal would introduce new, stronger CO[2] emission standards for
   heavy-duty vehicles from 2030 onwards, and extend the scope of the
   Regulation to cover smaller trucks, city buses, long-distance buses and
   trailers.
   Previous targets: 2025 -15%, 2030 -30%. New targets: 2030 -45%, 2035
   -65%, 2040 -90%.

   To stimulate faster deployment of zero-emission buses in cities, the
   Commission also proposes to make all new city buses zero-emission as of
   2030.

   The new targets build on those adopted in 2019, which were the
   first-ever EU-wide CO[2] emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles.

   To enter into force, the Commission’s proposal now needs to be adopted
   by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.

Main benefits

   If adopted, our proposal will:
   hdv_icon_decrease
   Decrease CO[2] emissions per km from new HDV by 90% by 2040, as
   compared to the reference period (1 July 2019 – 30 June 2020), with
   intermediate targets for 2030 (45%) and 2035 (65%)
   hdv_icon_neutrality
   Help reach the EU's 2050 climate neutrality target and boost
   zero-emission mobility
   hdv_icon_health
   Improve air quality and health of Europeans by cutting the level of air
   pollutants, especially in towns and cities
   hdv_icon_cost
   Reduce the fuel expenditure and total cost of ownership for transport
   operators and all users
   hdv_icon_dependency
   Lower the EU’s energy dependency on imported fossil fuels, and enhance
   energy savings and efficiency in the transport sector
   hdv_icon_industry
   Provide a clear signal to industry to pursue a zero-emission pathway by
   investing in innovative zero-emission technologies
   hdv_icon_zero
   Increase the share of zero and low-emission vehicles in the market and
   accelerate the roll-out of recharging and refuelling infrastructure
   hdv_icon_innovation
   Strengthen the technological and innovation leadership of industry in
   the EU and create new jobs

Regulation on CO₂ emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles

   Until the revision is adopted, the [76]Regulation on CO2 emission
   standards for heavy-duty vehicles applies. This Regulation entered into
   force on 14 August 2019.

   As per the Regulation, from 2025 onwards, manufacturers will have to
   meet the targets set for the fleet-wide average CO[2] emissions of
   their new lorries registered in a given calendar year. Stricter targets
   will start applying from 2030 on.

   The targets are expressed as a percentage reduction of emissions
   compared to the EU average in the reference period (1 July 2019–30 June
   2020):
     * From 2025 onwards: 15% reduction
     * From 2030 onwards: 30% reduction

   The 2025 target can be achieved using technologies that are already
   available on the market. The 2030 target has been assessed as part of
   the review of the Regulation.

   As a first step, the CO[2] emission standards cover large lorries,
   which account for over 73% of all CO[2] emissions from heavy-duty
   vehicles.

Incentive mechanism for zero- and low-emission vehicles (ZLEV)

   The Regulation includes an incentive mechanism for
     * Zero-emission vehicles (ZEV), lorries without an internal
       combustion engine, or with an internal combustion engine that emits
       less than 1gCO[2 ]per kWh[]or per km;
     * Low-emission vehicles (LEV), lorries with a technically permissible
       maximum laden mass of more than 16t, with CO[2] emissions of less
       than half of the average CO[2] emissions of all vehicles in its
       group registered in the 2019 reporting period.

   To incentivise the uptake of ZLEV and reward early action, a
   super-credits system applies from 2019 until 2024, and can be used to
   comply with the target in 2025. A multiplier of 2 applies for ZEV, and
   a multiplier between 1 and 2 applies for LEV, depending on their CO[2]
   emissions. An overall cap of 3% is set to preserve the environmental
   integrity of the system.

   From 2025 onwards, the super-credits system is replaced by a
   benchmark-based crediting system, with a benchmark set at 2%. The 2030
   benchmark level will have to be set in the context of the 2022 review.

   As a result, the average specific CO[2] emissions of a manufacturer are
   adjusted downwards if the share of ZLEV in its entire new heavy-duty
   vehicles fleet exceeds the 2% benchmark, out of which at least 0.75
   percentage points have to be vehicles subject to the CO[2] targets,
   i.e. the largest vehicles. Each percentage point of exceedance of the
   benchmark will decrease the manufacturer’s average specific CO[2]
   emissions by one percent.

   In both systems, ZEV not subject to the CO[2] targets are accounted in
   the incentive mechanism. Buses and coaches are excluded from the
   scheme. The ZEV not subject to the CO[2] targets can contribute to a
   maximum of 1.5% CO[2] emissions reduction.

Cost-effective achievement of targets

   The Regulation includes several elements to support cost-effective
   implementation:
     * Banking and borrowing to take account of long production cycles,
       including a reward for early action, while maintaining the
       environmental integrity of the targets.
     * Full flexibility for manufacturers to balance emissions between the
       different groups of vehicles within their portfolio.
     * Vocational vehicles , such as garbage trucks and construction
       vehicles, are exempted due to their limited potential for
       cost-efficient CO[2] reduction.

Governance

   The following measures will ensure the effectiveness and enforcement of
   the targets. They are based on the experience from [77]cars and
   [78]vans :
     * Assess the robustness and representativeness of the reference CO[2]
       emissions as a basis for calculating the EU fleet-wide emissions
       targets.
     * Collect, publish and monitor real-world fuel consumption data
       reported by manufacturers, based on mandatory standardised fuel
       consumption meters
     * Introduce in-service conformity tests and mandate the reporting of
       deviations and the introduction of a correction mechanism
     * Apply financial penalties in case of non-compliance with the CO[2]
       targets. The level of the penalties is set to 4,250 euro per
       gCO[2]/tkm in 2025 and 6,800 euro per gCO[2]/tkm in 2030.

Monitoring and reporting of CO₂ emissions from heavy-duty vehicles

   The following measures enable the implementation of the emission
   standards:
     * [79]Certification Regulation on the determination of the CO[2]
       emissions and fuel consumption of new lorries
     * [80]Regulation (EU) 2018/956 on monitoring and reporting

   The monitoring and reporting Regulation mandates the following
   monitoring and reporting requirements (with data from 1 January 2019
   onwards): :
     * Member States monitor and report to the Commission information on
       the heavy-duty vehicles registered for the first time in the Union;
     * Lorry manufacturers monitor and report to the Commission CO[2]
       emission and fuel consumption data as determined pursuant to the
       certification Regulation for each new vehicle produced for the EU
       market. This information will be calculated using the Vehicle
       Energy Consumption Calculation Tool ([81]VECTO).

   The collected data on CO[2] emissions and fuel consumption, together
   with other relevant technical information on the vehicles, including
   the aerodynamic drag, is made publicly available by the [82]European
   Environment Agency on behalf of the Commission

   The new system complements the existing EU reporting system for cars
   and vans.

Vehicle Energy Consumption Calculation Tool (VECTO)

   VECTO is a simulation software that can be used cost-efficiently and
   reliably to measure the CO[2] emissions and fuel consumption of
   heavy-duty vehicles for specific loads, fuels and mission profiles
   (e.g. long haul, regional delivery, urban delivery, etc.), based on
   input data from relevant vehicle components.

   The tool has been developed by the Commission in close cooperation with
   stakeholders.

Special Duties &amp; Other Assignments

SPECIAL DUTIES. EXTRAORDINARY ROLES.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Marines often serve in a variety of special capacities, whether
   protecting our Nation’s embassies abroad, recruiting the next
   generation of United States Marines, or even serving the United States
   Special Operations Command as a MARSOC Raider. These duties are earned
   by Marines who have proven their exceptional ability to fight and win
   in the primary [56]Military Occupational Specialties (MOSs).
     __________________________________________________________________

BEYOND THE CALL OF NORMAL DUTY.

   Every Marine takes on a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) for which
   he or she is optimally trained, but beyond these roles are the
   opportunities to take on special duty assignments. Many of these
   advanced opportunities are called “B” Billets, a designation separate
   from a Marine’s primary MOS. Explore these critical but atypical roles
   in the Corps.

RECRUITING DUTY

   Recruiting duty is a vital assignment in the Marine Corps, as it puts
   Marines in the position of ensuring the standards of our Corps remain
   high. Those Marines selected for recruiting duty carry the essential
   duty of screening, selecting, and preparing the next generation of
   Marines for the physical and mental rigors of recruit training.
     __________________________________________________________________

DRILL INSTRUCTOR DUTY

   Those Marines selected to serve on Drill Instructor Duty carry the
   essential responsibility of directly shaping the future of the Marine
   Corps, providing guidance, discipline, and direction for future
   Marines.
     __________________________________________________________________

     “These recruits are entrusted to my care. I will train them to the
     best of my ability. I will develop them into smartly disciplined,
     physically fit, basically trained Marines, thoroughly indoctrinated
     in love of Corps and country. I will demand of them, and demonstrate
     by my own example, the highest standards of personal conduct,
     morality and professional skill."

     —Excerpt from Drill Instructor's Creed

MARINE SECURITY GUARD/EMBASSY DUTY

   The Marine Corps is the only military service that is entrusted with
   the responsibility of providing security for U.S. Embassies and
   Consulates around the world. Marines selected for these special duty
   assignments will have the opportunity to serve at embassies and
   consulates located in various countries around the globe.
     __________________________________________________________________

SECURITY FORCES

   Security Force duty is among the most challenging the Corps offers, and
   Marines who take on this opportunity must be highly-trained in advanced
   security procedures. Our Nation places special trusts in these Marines,
   as they are assigned the responsibility of maintaining a worldwide
   presence, guarding and protecting key naval assets and special
   strategic weapons.
     __________________________________________________________________

MARINE CORPS SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND

   Ready to stand on the frontline of any battle, the Marine Raiders of
   MARSOC are built up in their Corps ethos, warfighting philosophy and
   values and represent the Marine Corps contribution to the United States
   Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). Two of the prominent roles within
   the Marine Raider community include Critical Skills Operators, who
   support the full spectrum of special operations on a global scale, and
   Special Operations Capability Specialists, who provide combat support
   expertise in intelligence, fire support, communications, EOD, and
   canine operations.

   November 10, 2023

   Call of Duty is a [229]video game series and [230]media franchise
   published by [231]Activision, starting in 2003. The games were first
   developed by [232]Infinity Ward, then by [233]Treyarch and
   [234]Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and handheld games were made
   by other developers. The most recent title, [235]Call of Duty: Modern
   Warfare III, was released on November 10, 2023.

   The series originally focused on the World War II setting, with
   Infinity Ward developing [236]Call of Duty (2003) and [237]Call of Duty
   2 (2005) and [238]Treyarch developing [239]Call of Duty 3 (2006).
   [240]Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) introduced a modern setting,
   and proved to be the breakthrough title for the series, creating the
   Modern Warfare sub-series; a [241]Modern Warfare remastered version
   released in 2016. Two other entries, [242]Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and
   [243]Modern Warfare 3 (2011), were made. The sub-series received a
   reboot with [244]Modern Warfare in 2019, [245]Modern Warfare II in
   2022, and Modern Warfare III in 2023. Infinity Ward have also developed
   two games outside of the Modern Warfare sub-series, [246]Ghosts (2013)
   and [247]Infinite Warfare (2016).

   Treyarch made one last World War II-based game, [248]World at War
   (2008), before releasing [249]Black Ops (2010) and subsequently
   creating the Black Ops sub-series. Four other entries, [250]Black Ops
   II (2012), [251]Black Ops III (2015), [252]Black Ops 4 (2018), and
   [253]Cold War (2020) were made, the latter in conjunction with
   [254]Raven Software. Sledgehammer Games, who were co-developers for
   Modern Warfare 3, have also developed three titles, [255]Advanced
   Warfare (2014), [256]Call of Duty: WWII (2017), and [257]Vanguard
   (2021). They are also the lead developer for Modern Warfare III (2023),
   the third entry in the Modern Warfare reboot sub-series.

   As of April 2021^[258][update], Call of Duty has sold over 400 million
   copies.^[259][1] The series is verified by the [260]Guinness World
   Records as the best-selling first-person shooter game series. It is
   also the most successful video game franchise created in the United
   States and the fourth [261]best-selling video game franchise of all
   time. Other products in the franchise include a line of [262]action
   figures designed by [263]Plan B Toys, a [264]card game created by
   [265]Upper Deck Company, Mega Bloks sets by [266]Mega Brands, and a
   [267]comic book miniseries published by [268]WildStorm Productions, and
   a feature film in development.

Esports

   alongside the game released at the time, [564]Call of Duty 4: Modern
   Warfare.^[565][83] Over the years, the series has extended with
   releases such as [566]Call of Duty: World at War, [567]Call of Duty:

   Ghosts, and [572]Call of Duty: Mobile. Games are played in leagues like
   [573]Major League Gaming.

   Players can compete in ladders or tournaments. The ladders are divided
   into several sub ladders such as the singles ladder, doubles ladder,
   team ladder (3v3 – 6v6) and hardcore team ladder (3v3 – 6v6). The
   difference between the regular team ladder and the hardcore team ladder
   is the in-game settings and thus a rule differentiation. Winning ladder
   matches on a competitive website rewards the user with experience
   points which add up to give them an overall rank.^[574][84]

   The tournaments offered on these websites provide players with the
   opportunity to win cash prizes and trophies. The trophies are
   registered and saved on the player's profile if/when they win a
   tournament, and the prize money is deposited into his or her bank
   account. Call of Duty: Ghosts was the most competitively played game in
   2014, with an average of 15,000 teams participating every
   season.^[575][85]

   For the past 6 seasons in competitive Call of Duty, [576]Full Sail
   University has hosted a prize giveaway, giving $2,500 to the top team
   each season.^[577][86] The other ladders give out credits and medals
   registered on players' profiles. Tournaments hosted on the Call of
   Duty: Ghosts's Arena give cost from 15 to 30 credits, thus averaging at
   a cost of about $18.75 per tournament. If the player competes with a
   team, the prize money is divided, and an equal cut is given to each
   player. Other tournaments with substantial prizes are hosted in
   specific cities and countries for [578]LAN teams.

   The biggest Call of Duty tournament hosted was [579]Call of Duty:
   Experience 2011, a tournament that began when Call of Duty: Modern
   Warfare 3 was released.^[580][87]

   Playing Call of Duty competitively is most popular in Europe and North
   America, with users who participate in tournaments and ladder matches
   daily.^[581][88]

   [585]Chicago, [586]Dallas, [587]Florida, [588]London, [589]Minnesota,

   service organizations.^[607][93] In November 2014, the endowment
   launched the "Race to 1,000 Jobs" campaign to encourage gamers to
   donate money to and get involved in organizations that provide veterans
   with services.^[608][94] As of 2015^[609][update], the Call of Duty

   [618]Electronic Arts. West and Zampella, as well as several Infinity
   Ward staff that departed the studio alongside them to join Respawn,
   filed lawsuits against Activision related to unpaid royalties and
   bonuses.

  Trademark infringement claims by AM General

   [619]AM General, the manufacturer of the [620]Humvee, sued Activision
   in 2017 for using the Humvee in multiple Call of Duty games.^[621][97]
   A federal district judge gave Activision a summary motion in its favor
   to dismiss the case in April 2020, stating that the purpose of the use
   of the Humvee in the games, to provide military realism, was quite
   different from the trademark purpose that AM General had established,
   for selling to the military.^[622][98]

Prevent duty training: Learn how to support people susceptible to
radicalisation

   Prevent sits alongside long-established safeguarding duties on
   professionals to protect people from a range of other harms such as
   substance abuse, involvement in gangs and physical and sexual
   exploitation.

   Prevent is one part of the government's overall counter-terrorism
   strategy, CONTEST. The aim of Prevent is to:
     * tackle the ideological causes of terrorism
     * intervene early to support people susceptible to radicalisation
     * enable people who have already engaged in terrorism to disengage
       and rehabilitate

Who Prevent duty training is for

   This training is for people working in sectors covered by the Prevent
   duty, such as:
     * education
     * health
     * local authorities
     * police
     * criminal justice agencies (prisons, probation, youth justice)

   Other sectors that are not covered by the Prevent duty may also
   complete this training.

Prevent duty courses

   In these training courses, you will learn about:
     * the Prevent duty
     * different extremist ideologies that can lead to terrorism
     * the risk around radicalisation and your supportive role
     * making a Prevent referral that is both informed and made with good
       intention
     * the interventions and support available

Help and further information

   If you experience any issues with the service or our site, refer to
   our [9]help section. A link can be found at the footer of every page.

   This service is also available [10]in Welsh (Cymraeg)

   you have a concern about an individual that you would like to share,
   please contact your [11]local council or call the national police
   Prevent advice line on 0800 011 3764.

What Is a Duty?

   The term "duty" refers to a form of taxation levied on certain goods,
   services, or other transactions. People and [157]corporations may be
   required to pay levies on [158]imports and exports by governments in
   the form of customs duties and other taxes. This is done in order to
   collect revenue and to satisfy other economic reasons. Duties are
   enforceable by law and may be imposed on [159]commodities or financial
   [160]transactions instead of individuals.

   The term also refers to the responsibilities held by an individual,
   especially someone in a position of power.

Key Takeaways

     * A duty is a form of taxation levied on certain goods, services, or
       other transactions that are imported and exported.
     * Duty rates are a percentage determined by the total value of the
       goods paid for in another country.
     * Duties provide a form of commerce protection for jobs, the economy,
       the environment, and other interests by controlling the influx and
       outflow of merchandise.
     * A duty may also be someone's moral or fiduciary responsibility.

Understanding a Duty

   Governments impose taxes on individuals and companies that make or
   receive shipments internationally. These levies must be paid before
   [161]delivery can be made. These levies are called customs or
   [162]import duties. These are [163]tariffs or taxes imposed on goods
   transported across international borders.

   Customs duty rates are a percentage determined by the total value of
   the goods paid for in another country. The quality, size, or weight of
   the product are not determining factors. The Harmonized Tariff System
   of the United States is used domestically as a reference for applicable
   tariffs on merchandise imported to the country.

   The intent of this form of duty is to provide a form of [164]commerce
   protection for each country's jobs, [165]economy, environment, and
   other interests by controlling the influx and outflow of merchandise.
   Duties may be imposed on restrictive and prohibited goods that are
   shipped in and out of a country. The imposition and collection of
   duties also help contribute to a nation's revenue pool.

Duties When Traveling

   This form of duty can be revoked in certain situations such as an
   airport's [166]duty-free shop. When customers patronize a duty-free
   shop, commodities that are usually taxed such as cigarettes and alcohol
   will not have a duty levied on them. Foreign visitors will then be able
   to purchase the goods at a lower [167]price compared to domestic
   citizens.

   There are limits and guidelines for shopping duty-free. The products
   purchased are intended to be taken out of the country where they were
   bought. Shoppers generally have to show their passports when making
   duty-free purchases.

   Travelers who make duty-free purchases may be required to declare to
   customs officials what they bought once they arrive back in their
   respective home countries. They may be required to show receipts for
   the purchases. Monetary limits on the value of duty-free purchases may
   be set. If the value exceeds the threshold, tariffs and local taxes may
   be imposed on the purchases.

   The U.S. Customs and Border Protection will outline the details
   regarding duties on a variety of products. Specific details are
   outlined for tobacco and alcoholic products as well as items being
   brought in from Cuba.﻿﻿

Special Considerations

   The term "duty" may also refer to any responsibilities—whether moral or
   otherwise—held by an individual. These are obligations that a
   person—especially someone in a position of authority—has to fulfill the
   responsibilities of their position.

   In a corporate context, this is a fiduciary responsibility that a
   company's [168]chief executive officer (CEO) has to the company's
   [169]shareholders. This means that any course of action the CEO takes
   should be in the best interests of the company's shareholders. For
   example, a CEO's duty can include weighing whether or not a merger deal
   with a rival would provide adequate [170]shareholder value.

   This responsibility is also similar to a [171]fiduciary duty. A
   fiduciary duty is when an individual places their trust and reliance on
   another in regards to a monetary situation. For example, a financial
   adviser would have a fiduciary duty to their clients and must act in
   the best interest of their clients. The same would hold true for an
   executor of an estate. The fiduciary has a duty to take responsibility
   and make decisions that will benefit the client above anyone else.

Consumer Duty – information for firms

   First published: 03/10/2022 Last updated: 01/11/2023 [121]See all
   updates

   To help firms implement the Duty, we explain more on the areas of the
   Duty that we have been receiving firm queries on which are relevant for
   the wider market.

   We will keep this updated.

   [122]

   Our approach to supervision and enforcement

   When the Duty comes into force firms need to make sure, and be able to
   show us, that they are acting to deliver good customer outcomes.

   We will be proportionate to the harm – or risk of harm - to consumers,
   prioritising the most serious breaches and acting swiftly and
   assertively. In some cases, firms can expect us to take robust action,
   such as interventions or investigations, along with possible
   disciplinary sanctions.

   We understand that some firms will need to continually improve the way
   they use data and analytics to demonstrate compliance and we will be
   pragmatic and open in working with them on this.
   [123]

   Our expectations for outcomes monitoring

   A key part of the Duty is that firms assess, test, understand and
   evidence the outcomes their customers are receiving. Without this, it
   will be impossible for firms to know that they are meeting the
   requirements set out in the Consumer Duty.

   The type of information firms will use will vary depending on factors
   like:
     * size
     * client base
     * types of products and services that they offer

   Firms will need to use their judgement to identify data sources as
   evidence against the outcomes of the Duty. Chapter 11 of our
   [124]Finalised Guidance gives examples of the types of data firms could
   collect.

    Monitoring outcomes is only required after the implementation
   deadline. But we recommend that firms start monitoring sooner to check
   they’re ready in time.

   During the implementation period we will monitor firms’ readiness and
   feed back insights to the market.

   We want firms’ Boards and senior management to make good outcomes for
   consumers central to their firm’s culture, strategy and business
   objectives.

   In [126]FG22/5, we said that we expect firms to have a champion at
   Board (or equivalent governing body) level. We said that this champion
   should be an Independent Non-Executive Director (NED), where possible.
   For larger organisations with group structures, we expect this champion
   to be at an appropriate Board level so that the Duty is discussed in a
   meaningful way.

   The primary role of the Board champion is to support the Chair and CEO
   in raising the Duty regularly in all relevant discussions, and
   challenging the firm’s governing body/management on how it is embedding
   the Duty and focusing on consumer outcomes.

   This is not a ‘prescribed responsibility’ under the Senior Managers &amp;
   Certification Regime (SM&amp;CR). Firms can set it up in a way that fits
   with existing roles and responsibilities on their Boards.

   Generally, the Board champion should work with the Chair, but this will
   depend on the firm and its Board. In some cases, it may work for the
   Chair to be the Board champion for the Duty. Firms should apply their
   judgement and set up the role in a way that works for their
   organisation.

   This does not affect the Board’s collective responsibility under the
   Duty or their roles in complying with the Duty under existing
   governance procedures.

   In FG22/5, we have included examples of the types of questions the
   Board champion, or other members of firms’ governing bodies, could ask
   to make sure the firm is meeting expectations under the Duty. These
   questions illustrate the outcome focus of the Duty and are the sorts of
   questions we will ask firms.
   [127]

   Definition of closed products

   The Duty comes into effect on:
     * 31 July 2023 - for new and existing products or services that are
       open for sale or renewal
     * 31 July 2024 - for closed products or services

   ‘Closed products’ are no longer marketed or distributed to retail
   customers nor open to renewal.

   If existing customers can continue to make payments under the existing
   product terms, this would still be considered ‘closed’ if the product
   or service is not open to new customers. For example, a pension product
   that is no longer sold to new customers, but where existing
   policyholders can continue to pay in contributions, would be considered
   closed.

   It is up to firms to consider each product and determine whether it is
   closed.
   [128]

   Retrospective application

   The Consumer Duty does not apply retrospectively. Both we and the
   Financial Ombudsman Service work on the basis that conduct should be
   judged on the rules and standards in place at that time.

   We have been working closely with the Financial Ombudsman to make sure
   our interpretations are consistent, while recognising the different
   roles that we both play.
   [129]

   Proportionality

   The Duty applies in a reasonable way. The focus on good customer
   outcomes applies to all aspects of firms’ operations and culture. All
   firms have a Duty to act to deliver good outcomes for their customers.
   What this means in practice will depend on key factors, including:
     * The nature of the product or service. More complicated products are
       likely to need more attention than simpler or less risky products.
     * The characteristics of a firm’s customers. Where customers are more
       likely to have characteristics of vulnerability, for example, we
       would expect it to take additional care.
     * The firm’s relationship with its customers. Obligations under the
       Duty reflect the firm’s role and ability to influence retail
       customer outcomes. We would expect firms to focus on harms that are
       reasonably foreseeable.
     * The size of the firm. We do not expect a small firm to apply the
       same resources or processes as a large firm.

   We set out more on how the Duty applies reasonably in Chapter 4 of
   [130]FG22/5.

   [131]

   Requirements for firms seeking authorisation

   If your firm is in scope of the Consumer Duty, your application must
   prove that you can comply with the Consumer Duty. We expect your
   application to be tailored to your firm and expressly set out how your
   firm will act to consistently deliver good outcomes to retail
   customers.

   To help us assess whether you can comply with the Consumer Duty you
   should provide all the policies, processes, Management Information (MI)
   and any other materials you have created or rely on to support your
   firm’s compliance with the Consumer Duty. These should include the
   following. This is not an exhaustive list and you may be asked to
   review and amend any documents you submit or create new documents
   should they deemed to be missing:
     * target market analysis and identification
     * a product and service governance framework
     * a fair value assessment framework
     * customer understanding assessment &amp; testing framework
     * customer support monitoring polices and supporting Management
       Information (MI) suite
     * customer outcome monitoring framework
     * root cause identification process

   [132]

   How the Duty applies to firms throughout the distribution chain

   The Duty applies to all firms with a key role in delivering retail
   customer outcomes, including those with no direct customer
   relationship. For example, it applies to firms that can determine or
   influence:
     * the design or operation of retail products or services, including
       their price and value
     * communications with retail customers
     * customer support for retail customers

   Where this applies, a firm’s responsibilities under the Duty will
   depend on the firm’s role and level of influence.

   See Chapter 2 of our [133]Finalised Guidance for how the Duty applies
   across the distribution chain.
   [134]

   Information-sharing in the distribution chain

   Manufacturers and distributors need to work together and share
   information, in order to perform their own roles effectively and
   deliver good outcomes.

   Distributors should have a clear understanding of the target market and
   the way products operate. We expect distributors to get the information
   they need from manufacturers, and manufacturers to be monitoring that
   their products are delivering good consumer outcomes.

   6.68 of [135]FG22/5 includes examples of the type of information we
   would expect to be shared, where appropriate.

   In general, we do not expect distributors to share information without
   being asked. We expect the manufacturer to consider what information
   would be helpful and to take reasonable steps to gather it. For
   example, through focus groups or sending surveys to distributors.

   Unless there are regulatory or contractual requirements, firms are only
   responsible for their own activities and do not need to oversee the
   actions of other firms in the distribution chain.

   If a firm identifies consumer harm elsewhere in the chain it must raise
   the concerns with other relevant parties. This could include situations
   where a distributor identifies foreseeable harm or problems with the
   way a product or service is operating in practice.

   Firms must also notify us where they become aware that another firm in
   the distribution chain may not be complying with the Duty. This
   expectation is in line with the existing Principle 11 requirement to
   inform us of anything relating to the firm which we reasonably expect
   notice of.
   [136]

   Application to non-UK firms

   Only firms conducting regulated activities in the UK are within our
   regulatory remit and subject to the Duty.

   Where the distribution chain involves firms in Gibraltar selling
   products or services to UK retail customers, the Duty still applies. It
   applies to those firms whether they have an establishment in the UK or
   operate on a cross-border basis.

   We recognise that risks remain for UK retail customers if the
   distribution chain involves other parties outside the UK that are not
   subject to equivalent requirements. To help manage this risk, UK
   distributors of non-UK products and services must take all reasonable
   steps to understand the product or service, the target market it would
   serve and the value it provides so that it will be distributed
   appropriately.

   Regulated firms should also consider whether including a firm that is
   not subject to the Duty in the distribution chain leads to a risk of
   poor customer outcomes.

   There is more information on application outside of the UK in Chapter 2
   of our [137]FG22/5.
   [138]

   Application to non-UK customers

   For firms dealing with non-UK customers, the Duty applies in line with
   the existing regulatory perimeter. Where current rules apply to a UK
   firm dealing with non-UK customers, the Duty will also apply.

   Where the chain includes firms outside the UK, which are not subject to
   the Duty, we recognise that UK firms may not be able to meet elements
   of the Duty to the same degree. A UK product manufacturer may find it
   difficult to obtain information from non-UK distributors about their
   distribution of the product.

   In this case, UK firms should consider what is reasonable in the
   circumstances. For example, they could use any information that they do
   have available to support their work. We would not expect UK firms to
   obtain information from firms that are not subject to the Duty.
   [139]

   Clarifying the scope

   We have made some changes in the [140]March 2023 Handbook Notice to
   make certain points clearer in the rules:
     * The application to firms approving or communicating financial
       promotions
     * The application to firms in the temporary marketing permissions
       regime (TMPR)
     * The ‘closed product’ and ‘existing product’ definitions
     * The application to credit unions

   This follows on from our [141]consultation in December 2022 and the
   changes are consistent with our position in Consultation Paper
   [142]CP21/36.

   We are still considering responses to the December consultation in
   relation to the amendments we had proposed on:
     * Defined benefit occupational pension schemes
     * Non-retail financial instruments
     * Exemptions in sectoral Sourcebooks

   If we take any of these proposals forward, we will grant an appropriate
   implementation period for any changes we make to the rules.
   [143]

   Data protection law and customer communications

   Under the Consumer Understanding outcome, we expect consumers to be
   given the information they need, at the right time, and presented in a
   way they can understand.

   Data protection laws (the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018) and the
   Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR) don't
   stop firms from telling customers about better deals or providing
   information that they need to know as part of their relationship with
   that firm.

   Administrative or customer service messages aren't considered to be
   direct marketing, so there are no restrictions on communicating this
   type of information. Firms can also provide regulatory communications
   to all customers that provide neutral, factual information. For
   example, information about the product they hold, terms of other
   available products, and what their options are for moving to another
   product.

   The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) [144]guidance on direct
   marketing and regulatory communications explains how to draft
   regulatory communications, and includes illustrative examples.

   Call of Duty is a 2003 [138]first-person shooter game developed by
   [139]Infinity Ward and published by [140]Activision. It is the first
   installment in the [141]Call of Duty franchise,^[142][3] released on
   October 29, 2003, for [143]Microsoft Windows. The game simulates
   [144]infantry and [145]combined arms warfare of [146]World War II using
   a modified version of the [147]id Tech 3 engine. Much of its theme and
   gameplay is similar to the [148]Medal of Honor series; however, Call of
   Duty showcases multiple viewpoints staged in the [149]American,
   [150]British, and [151]Soviet theaters of World War II.

   The game introduced a new take on AI-controlled allies who support the
   player during missions and react to situational changes during
   gameplay. This led to a greater emphasis on squad-based play as opposed
   to the "lone wolf" approach often portrayed in earlier first-person
   shooter games. Much of Infinity Ward's development team consisted of
   members who helped develop [152]Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. The
   game received critical acclaim and won several Game of the Year awards
   from reviewers.

   In September 2004, an expansion pack called [153]Call of Duty: United
   Offensive, which was produced by Activision and developed by [154]Gray
   Matter Studios and [155]Pi Studios, was released. At the same time the
   N-Gage Version got an Arena Pack with 3 new Levels.^[156][4] An
   enhanced port of Call of Duty for the [157]PlayStation 3 and [158]Xbox
   360, titled Call of Duty: Classic, developed by [159]Aspyr, was
   released worldwide in November 2009 with the release of [160]Call of
   Duty: Modern Warfare 2, being available via redemption codes included
   with the "Hardened" and "Prestige" editions of the game.^[161][5]

Gameplay[[162]edit]

   [163][210px-CallDuty1PC.jpg] In-game screenshot of Call of Duty on PC

   As a [164]first-person shooter, Call of Duty places the player in
   control of an infantry soldier who makes use of various authentic World
   War II firearms in combat. Each mission features a series of objectives
   that are marked on the [165]heads-up display's compass; the player must
   complete all objectives to advance to the next mission. The player can
   save and load at any time, rather than the checkpoint system utilized
   in later Call of Duty games.

   The player has two primary weapon slots, a handgun slot, and can carry
   up to ten grenades. Weapons may be exchanged with those found on the
   battlefield dropped by dead soldiers. Unlike later Call of Duty games,
   the first allows the player to toggle between different firing modes
   (single shot or automatic fire). Call of Duty was one of the early
   first-person shooters to feature [166]iron sights in game play; by
   pressing the corresponding key the player aims down the gun's actual
   sights for increased accuracy. In addition to weapons carried by the
   player, mounted [167]machine guns and other fixed weapon emplacements
   are controllable by the player.

   The game uses a standard [168]health points system, with a limited
   amount of health reflected by a health bar. [169]Medkits scattered
   throughout the levels or dropped by some foes are used to restore
   health when the player is injured.

   Call of Duty also featured "shellshock" (not to be confused with the
   psychological condition of the [170]same name): when there is an
   explosion near the player, he momentarily experiences simulated
   [171]tinnitus, appropriate sound "muffling" effects, blurred vision,
   and also results in the player slowing down, unable to sprint.

   As the focus of the game is on simulation of the actual battlefield,
   the gameplay differed from many single-player shooters of the time. The
   player moves in conjunction with allied soldiers rather than alone;
   allied soldiers will assist the player in defeating enemy soldiers and
   advancing; however, the player is given charge of completing certain
   objectives. The game places heavy emphasis on usage of cover,
   [172]suppressive fire, and grenades. AI-controlled soldiers will take
   cover behind walls, barricades, and other obstacles when available.

Campaign[[173]edit]

  American campaign[[174]edit]

   The American campaign begins in August 1942 with [175]Private Martin, a
   newly enlisted member of the [176]506th Parachute Infantry Regiment,
   completing basic training at [177]Camp Toccoa. In June 1944, Martin
   [178]establishes a landing zone for soldiers participating in
   [179]Operation Overlord. The paratroopers are scattered, leaving Martin
   in a mixed unit formed from various [180]companies led by his [181]CO
   Cpt. Foley, who seize a nearby town from Germans. Martin and his unit
   are sent to force the remaining Germans from [182]Sainte-Mère-Église
   and disable several [183]Flakpanzers ([184]anti-aircraft tanks) as
   [185]D-Day begins. Martin's unit destroys German artillery positions
   attacking the landing force at [186]Utah Beach. Afterwards, Martin
   learns that his unit has been assigned to participate in an attack on a
   [187]Bavarian manor to rescue two British officers, [188]Captain Price
   and [189]Major Ingram. He learns from Price that Ingram had already
   been moved to a more secure POW camp for interrogation; Martin and
   Price infiltrate the camp and rescue Ingram. Martin's unit later takes
   part in the [190]Battle of the Bulge, successfully securing top-secret
   documents and stopping an attempt by the Germans to call in tanks.

  British campaign[[191]edit]

   The British campaign starts with Sergeant Jack Evans and a unit from
   [192]2nd Ox and Bucks of the [193]6th Airborne Division taking part in
   [194]Operation Tonga. The unit is dropped in [195]Horsa gliders near
   [196]Pegasus Bridge, [197]Bénouville. Led by Captain Price, Evans and
   his troops clear the bridge of German soldiers. The unit holds out
   against an attempt by a German battalion to retake the bridge with the
   help of the [198]7th Parachute Battalion.

   By September, Evans has been transferred to the [199]SAS. He takes part
   in a mission to sabotage the [200]Eder Dam, restored after being
   destroyed by the [201]No. 617 Squadron RAF during [202]Operation
   Chastise, destroying the [203]anti-aircraft guns protecting it.
   Following extraction, Evans helps to cut off pursuing German troops.
   Reaching a German airport to escape, Evans uses an anti-air gun to
   cover Price and Waters from German [204]Stuka dive-bombers as they
   procure and flee in a [205]Fw.200. Evans and Price then pose as German
   naval officers and sailors to infiltrate the battleship [206]Tirpitz,
   disable its defenses, and steals information for the [207]RAF to attack
   the ship. Price sacrifices himself to buy time for Evans, who escapes
   with Waters by boat. Later, Evans, Waters and their squad arrive near
   [208]Burgsteinfurt, Germany, to assist the impending Allied assault on
   the city. Discovering plans to launch [209]V-2 rockets at the Allied
   forces, the unit destroys them before joining the rest of the army.

  Soviet campaign[[210]edit]

   The Soviet campaign begins during the [211]Battle of Stalingrad in
   September 1942. [212]Corporal Alexei Ivanovich Voronin and his fellow
   recruits are sent across the [213]Volga River, many of whom are killed
   when the [214]Luftwaffe launch an attack. Once across, they call in an
   artillery strike that forces the Germans back. At Red Square with
   [215]Soviet officers killing soldiers who retreat, Voronin kills
   several German officer and soldiers, disrupting the German offense long
   enough for Soviet artillery to destroy their tanks. Voronin links up
   with surviving allies in a train station and guides them to Major Zubov
   of the [216]13th Guards Rifle Division; Voronin is promoted to
   [217]Junior Sergeant. In November, Voronin rendezvous with a unit led
   by [218]Sergeant [219]Pavlov, tasked with [220]retaking an apartment
   building in German hands. The unit assaults and clears the building,
   and defends it from a German counterattack.

   In January 1945, Voronin, now a full Sergeant, serves with the
   [221]150th Rifle Division of the [222]3rd Shock Army. The unit secures
   a makeshift German tank repair facility in Warsaw during the
   [223]Vistula–Oder Offensive, and regroup with the [224]4th Guards Tank
   Army. Due to shortages in experienced soldiers, Voronin commands a
   [225]T-34-85 tank for the [226]2nd Guards Tank Army, and helps the
   Soviets capture a town near the [227]Oder River. In April, Sergeant
   Voronin is returned to his old unit, the 150th Rifle Division. He and a
   small group of soldiers storm the [228]Reichstag building and raise the
   [229]Victory Banner atop the roof, ending the European war.

Development[[230]edit]

   [231][220px-E3_2003_%28343111642%29.jpg] Promotion at [232]E3 2003

   Call of Duty was developed by [233]Infinity Ward, a new studio formed
   in 2002 originally consisting of 21 employees, many of whom were
   project lead developers of the successful [234]Medal of Honor: Allied
   Assault released the same year. Led by Chief Creative Officer Vince
   Zampella, development began in April 2002, and the team grew to 27
   members by May 2003. At its beginning, the project was nicknamed "Medal
   of Honor Killer".^[235][6] Using an enhanced version of the [236]id
   Tech 3 game engine developed for [237]Quake III Arena and an in-house
   skeletal animation system called "Ares", Infinity Ward set out to
   develop a new World War II-era video game that, unlike many of its
   predecessors, placed more emphasis on squad-based play with intelligent
   assistance from teammates during large-scale battles. The team also
   extensively researched weapons, artillery, and vehicles from [238]World
   War II to enhance the authenticity of animation and sounds used
   throughout the game.^[239][7] The game's budget was $4.5
   million.^[240][8]

   Another area the development team focused on was their [241]artificial
   intelligence (AI) pathfinding component dubbed "Conduit". The ability
   to suppress the enemy with cover fire and clear obstacles, such as
   fences and windows, was tightly integrated into the squad-based aspect
   of the single-player campaigns. The AI in the game was designed to
   flank the opponent, bank grenades, and move from one cover point to
   another.^[242][2] Lead animation director Michael Boon explained that
   actions which would have normally been scripted in past games were
   moved to a dynamic AI environment, in order to help create a different
   experience each time levels are replayed.^[243][9] While the campaigns
   were the primary focus, development of the multiplayer modes were
   tailored to please [244]modders. Zied Rieke, a lead designer, clarified
   that gameplay and modes were written in script making it "extremely
   easy for players to make their own modifications to Call of Duty
   multiplayer".^[245][9]

  Critical reception[[259]edit]

   Call of Duty received "critical acclaim", according to [260]review
   aggregator [261]Metacritic.^[262][10] It won several "[263]Game of the
   Year" awards for 2003 from several reviewers.

   During the [264]7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as
   the [265]D.I.C.E. Awards), Call of Duty was honored "[266]Game of the
   Year" of 2003 by the [267]Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences; it
   also won awards for "Computer Game of the Year" and "[268]Computer
   First Person Action Game of the Year", along with nominations for
   "Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming", "[269]Outstanding
   Achievement in Original Music Composition", and "[270]Outstanding
   Achievement in Sound Design".^[271][16]

   [272]GameSpot named it the best computer game of October
   2003.^[273][17]

   [274]Computer Games Magazine named Call of Duty the sixth-best computer
   game of 2003, and the editors wrote, "This game ups the ante in the
   WWII shooter arena, and makes everything that has come before it seem
   as outdated as France's army."^[275][18] The editors of [276]Computer
   Gaming World presented Call of Duty with their 2003 "Shooter of the
   Year" award. They remarked, "Call of Duty won this category without a
   shot fired—there simply was no debate."^[277][19] It was also nominated
   for "Best Game" at the 2004 [278]Game Developers Choice Awards. While
   it did not receive that award, it did win Infinity Ward the "Rookie
   Studio of the Year". Chuck Russom was also presented with the
   "Excellence in Audio" award for his work on the game.^[279][20]

   [280]IGN rated the game 9.3/10, with reviewer Dan Adams saying "You
   have to love a game that glues you to your seat and keeps you
   interested... A thrilling piece of software that action fans should
   grab a hold of and love fiercely." His only negative critique was on
   the short length of the game, which many reviewers pointed
   out.^[281][21]

   The N-Gage version got "mixed or average reviews" on the site

   [284]The NPD Group named Call of Duty the eighth-best-selling computer
   game of 2003.^[285][23] It maintained this position on NPD's computer
   game sales rankings for the following year.^[286][24] In the United
   States alone, Call of Duty sold 790,000 copies and earned $29.6 million
   (~$38.8 million in 2021) by August 2006. At the time, this led
   [287]Edge to declare it the country's 13th-best-selling computer game
   released since January 2000.^[288][25]

   In the United Kingdom, Call of Duty sold 95,000 copies by the end of
   2003, which made it 88th-biggest seller across all platforms that
   year.^[289][26] Discussing this performance, Kristan Reed of
   [290]GamesIndustry.biz wrote that "Activision will be pleased that it
   managed to interrupt the [291]Sims party" with the game's
   release.^[292][27] Call of Duty ultimately received a "Silver" sales
   award from the [293]Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers
   Association (ELSPA),^[294][28] indicating sales of at least 100,000
   copies in the United Kingdom.^[295][29]

   Call of Duty ultimately sold 4.5 million copies worldwide by
   2013.^[296][30]

Franchise[[297]edit]

   Main article: [298]Call of Duty

   Call of Duty spawned numerous spin-offs and sequels, part of the
   [299]Call of Duty series. Its expansion pack - [300]Call of Duty:
   United Offensive was developed by [301]Gray Matter Studios and released
   September 14, 2004. [302]Call of Duty 2 was also developed by Infinity
   Ward and was released in October 2005. Some Call of Duty spinoffs were
   developed for consoles, such as [303]Call of Duty: Finest Hour by
   [304]Spark Unlimited and [305]Call of Duty 2: Big Red One by Gray
   Matter Studios (merged into [306]Treyarch). The franchise eventually
   had over fifteen more sequels and spin offs.

Ports[[307]edit]

   Call of Duty Classic is a downloadable version of Call of Duty for
   [308]Xbox 360 and [309]PlayStation 3, featuring HD
   resolutions.^[310][31] Tokens to download the game ahead of its release
   were sold along with special "Hardened" and "Prestige" editions of
   [311]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,^[312][31] and the game was
   publicly released on December 2, 2009.

   [313]IGN rated this version 7.5, citing it as not well adapted to the
   consoles, as well as criticizing the multiplayer for only supporting up
   to eight players.^[314][32]

   Policy statements First published: 27/07/2022 Last updated: 27/07/2022

   We set out the final rules and guidance for a new Consumer Duty that
   will set higher and clearer standards of consumer protection across
   financial services and require firms to put their customers’ needs
   first. We also respond to feedback to CP21/36.

What we are changing 

   We are introducing rules comprising:
     * A new Consumer Principle that requires firms to act to deliver good
       outcomes for retail customers.
     * Cross-cutting rules providing greater clarity on our expectations
       under the new Principle and helping firms interpret the four
       outcomes (see below).
     * Rules relating to the four outcomes we want to see under the
       Consumer Duty. These represent key elements of the firm-consumer
       relationship which are instrumental in helping to drive good
       outcomes for customers.

   These outcomes relate to:
     * products and services
     * price and value
     * consumer understanding
     * consumer support

   Our rules require firms to consider the needs, characteristics and
   objectives of their customers – including those with characteristics of
   vulnerability – and how they behave, at every stage of the customer
   journey. As well as acting to deliver good customer outcomes, firms
   will need to understand and evidence whether those outcomes are being
   met.

Who this affects   

   This policy and guidance is likely to interest:   
     * regulated firms, including those in the e-money and payments sector

     * consumer organisations and individual consumers
     * industry groups/trade bodies
     * policy makers and regulatory bodies
     * industry experts and commentators
     * academics and think tanks

Next steps  

   The rules and guidance we are introducing come into force on a phased
   basis:
     * for new and existing products or services that are open to sale or
       renewal the rules come into force on 31 July 2023
     * for closed products or services, the rules come into force on 31
       July 2024

   During the implementation period, we'll be hosting a series of industry
   events to help firms prepare for the new rules coming into force. If
   you’d like to hear more about future Consumer Duty events and related
   communications, please [123]sign up for email updates.

   The Origin Procedures in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (Articles
   37 to 67) set out the process for goods to prove their originating
   status and how a reduced rate of Customs Duty (known as a tariff
   preference) can be claimed.

Claiming preferential tariff treatment

   Read the relevant [46]Trade and Cooperation Agreement articles:
     * Claim for preferential tariff treatment (article 54 on page 71 —
       section 2 — Origin Procedures)
     * Time of the claim for preferential tariff treatment (article 55 on
       page 72 — section 2 — Origin Procedures)
     * Small consignments (article 60 on page 76 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Confidentiality (article 64 on page 86 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)

How to claim preference

   The customs authority receiving the goods will grant preferential
   tariff treatment. This will be based on a claim made by the importer,
   for goods that originate in the partner country and meet the conditions
   of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.

   Under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, a claim can be made if the
   importer has one of the following proofs of origin:
     * a statement on origin that the product is originating, made out by
       the exporter
     * importer’s knowledge that the product is originating

   A claim for preference, and the ‘presentation’ of the proof of origin,
   is normally included on the customs declaration to enter the goods into
   free circulation. However, a claim can also be made after importation
   as long as it is made within 3 years of the importation date and
   accompanied with a valid proof of origin. In those circumstances any
   duties would be repaid to the importer.

   You can claim preference for different goods on the same document.
   You’ll need to clearly identify the goods that are originating and
   non-originating. There is no fixed method for doing this — the only
   requirement is that those goods are clearly indicated.

   In the UK, a [47]claim for duties to be repaid is made using C285,
   however there are different ways to claim the preferential rate of duty
   depending on which system you’re using to make your import declaration.

If you’re using Customs Declaration Service software

   Data Element (DE) What you must include
   DE 2/3 Must include one of the following codes, as appropriate:
   • U110 — if the claim is based on a ‘statement on origin’ for a single
   shipment
   • U111 — if the claim is based on a ‘statement on origin’ for multiple
   shipments of identical products to cover a 12-month
   • U112 — if the claim is based on importers knowledge, using status
   code JP
   Codes U110 and U111 must be declared with one of the following status
   codes: AE, AF, AG, AP, AS, AT, GE, GP, HP, JE, JP, LE, LP, UA, UE, UP,
   US, XB.
   DE 4/17 Must include a preference code in the 300 series.
   DE 5/16 Must be completed with the country of preferential origin.

   For goods imported from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021, traders
   will have up to 175 days to complete customs declarations. This will
   give traders extra time to make arrangements to evidence their claim to
   the preferential tariff rate.

Rules for small consignments of goods

   As long as they are declared to the customs authorities as meeting the
   origin rules, some goods may be imported without the need for a formal
   proof of origin (a waiver).

   For import into the EU, this waiver applies to goods valued under
   either:
     * 500 euros for products sent in small packages
     * 1,200 euros for products forming part of a traveller’s personal
       luggage

   For the EU, this waiver does not apply to commercial imports.

   For import into the UK, this waiver applies to any goods valued in
   total under £1,000, if they are imported for commercial or
   non-commercial purposes. Where the total value of the all the goods is
   over £1,000, you can only claim preference on those goods for which you
   can prove the preferential origin.

   These waivers do not apply if it is established that the import forms a
   series of importations that are being made separately to avoid the
   normal requirements.

Applying for preference using a statement on origin

   Read the relevant [48]Trade and Cooperation Agreement articles:
     * Cumulation of origin (article 40 on page 56 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Statement on origin (article 56 on page 73 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Discrepancies (article 57 on page 74 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Record-keeping requirements (article 59 on page 75 — section 2 —
       Origin Procedures)
     * Denial of preferential tariff treatment (article 63 on page 83 —
       section 2 — Origin Procedures)

Statement on origin

   One option for claiming preference is for the importer to use a
   ‘statement on origin’ made out by the exporter. A statement on origin
   is prescribed text which the exporter adds to the invoice or any other
   document that describes the originating product in enough detail to
   allow it to be identified. The statement or document may be in an
   electronic format.

   Other products, which may be included on the document, should be
   clearly distinguished from the originating products.

   An exporter completing a statement on origin must hold information
   showing that the product is originating, including information on the
   originating status of materials used in the production of the product.
   This may include declarations obtained from their suppliers.

   A statement on origin may apply to either:
     * a single consignment
     * multiple shipments of identical products within any period
       specified in the statement on origin but not more than 12 months
       from the date of the first import

   If an exporter completes a statement on origin and later becomes aware
   that it holds incorrect information, they must let their customer know
   immediately in writing.

   A statement may be made in English or any of the other official
   languages used in the EU. However, it is best to use the same language
   used for the document.

   The following sections in this guide have more details of requirements
   about the document, suppliers’ declarations and the exporter.

   The text of the statement on origin is shown in Annex 7 of the
   [49]Trade and Cooperation Agreement.

   You must hold a supplier declaration (when needed) at the time you
   issue a statement on origin.

   If you do not have a supplier declaration, or other information to show
   the originating status of the goods, for any statements on origin
   you’ve issued during the easement period (1 January 2021 to 31 December
   2021), then there is an obligation on you to let your customer know.

   If you’re subject to a request for verification and you cannot provide
   evidence to show that the goods you exported to the EU originate in the
   UK, your EU customer will be liable to pay the full rate of Customs
   Duty.

Exporter requirements

   The exporter:
     * must be located in the UK to export to the EU
     * must be located in the EU to export to the UK
     * can be any person (such as a producer or a trading company) as long
       as they fulfil the obligations under the Trade and Cooperation
       Agreement, the exporter does not need to lodge the customs export
       declaration in respect of the products — they can [50]appoint a
       customs representative to act on their behalf
     * exports or produces the originating product, and makes out a
       statement on origin
     * is responsible for the correct identification of the originating
       products on the invoice or any other document, including a
       commercial document

   They will usually be identified on the statement on origin by their
   exporter reference number. If an exporter’s reference number has not
   been assigned, the exporter may show their full address under ‘place
   and date’.

   In the EU, the exporter’s reference number will be the exporter’s
   registered exporter (REX) number. These are needed if the exporter
   exports consignments with a total value of more than 6,000 euros.

   In the UK, the exporter’s reference number will be the EORI number. If
   you do not have one, you can [51]apply for an EORI number.

   The statement on origin must be made out by the exporter. It does not
   need to give any details of the person issuing the document used for
   completing the statement. To avoid confusion, it is recommended that
   the exporter makes out the statement on origin on a document they have
   issued.

Validity of the statement on origin

   A statement on origin may be made out before, at the same time as, or
   after the products that it relates to are exported. For imports to the
   UK it will be valid for 2 years from the date it was made out. For
   exports to the EU it will be valid for 12 months.

   The statement on origin must be valid when the claim for preferential
   tariff treatment is made. This might be either the time when:
     * the import declaration in respect of the originating products is
       accepted by the customs authorities
     * an application for repayment or remission of customs duties is
       submitted

Supplier declarations

   Information in this section applies to supplier declarations that a UK
   supplier gives to either a UK producer or UK exporter. Goods and
   materials that originate under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and
   are imported from, or exported to, EU suppliers, must show their
   originating status through either a statement on origin or importer’s
   knowledge.

   For supplies of non-originating goods and materials, where some
   domestic production has been applied in the UK or EU, that production
   can be counted towards bilateral cumulation if the goods or materials
   are supported by the supplier declaration for non-originating goods as
   set out in:
     * Article 40 of the [52]Trade and Cooperation Agreement
     * Annex 6 (supplier declaration) of the [53]Trade and Cooperation
       Agreement

   A supplier uses a supplier declaration to give information to a
   producer or exporter about the originating status of goods, on the
   specific preferential rules of origin. The supplier is the person who
   has control and the knowledge of the originating status over the
   delivered goods.

   By completing a supplier declaration the supplier declares the
   originating status of the goods they provide to their customer. The
   customer needs this information to make out a statement on origin (the
   exported goods are either the finished product from the supplier or a
   product incorporating the delivered material).

When supplier declarations are needed

   There are occasions where manufacture on its own is not enough to meet
   the origin rules, and suppliers’ declarations are needed. For example,
   if:
     * any materials do not change tariff heading
     * the value of materials is over the specified limit, for example the
       origin rule may specify a percentage limit of 40% for
       non-originating materials, and the total value of materials used is
       45% of the ex-works price — you will then need declarations to
       cover the value of materials in excess of the limit, that is, 5% of
       the ex-works price
     * you manufacture using materials at a later stage of production than
       that specified, for example using bought-in fabric where the origin
       rule is manufacture from yarn
     * the only processing which you carry out on a product is among the
       minimal processes listed in Article 43 (page 61) of the [54]Trade
       and Cooperation Agreement
     * you buy and export goods in the same state

When supplier declarations are not needed

   If you are a manufacturer either exporting or supplying your goods,
   there are certain circumstances where a declaration will not be needed:
     * an origin rule may specify that all non-originating materials must
       change tariff heading (if, during manufacture, all materials change
       tariff heading then the rule is met without the need for any
       suppliers’ declarations)
     * a percentage rule may specify a limit on the value of
       non-originating materials (30% or 40%), if the total value of all
       materials is within this limit, then the rule will be met
     * an origin rule may specify manufacture from materials at a certain
       stage of production, for example manufacture from yarn, if you
       manufacture using materials at or before the specified stage (for
       example yarn or pre yarn) then the rule will be met automatically

   A supplier declaration can be made out to cover a single supply or to
   cover regular supplies made over a period of time (a long-term supplier
   declaration).

   Long-term supplier declarations are one-off declarations valid for
   supplies delivered during a period up to a maximum of 2 years.

   A long-term supplier declaration is valid for all the goods mentioned
   in the supplier declaration that are delivered within the specified
   period. When completing a long-term supplier declaration, the
   originating status of the goods must be confirmed for the whole period
   that it is valid for.

   The supplier should tell the customer of the goods immediately, if the
   information given in their long-term supplier declaration is no longer
   applicable.

   A long-term supplier declaration should be made out for consignments
   dispatched during a period of time and should give the date:
     * when the declaration is made out (date of issue)
     * of commencement of the period (start date) — which may not be more
       than 12 months before, or more than 6 months after the date of
       issue
     * of the end of the period (end date) — which may not be more than 24
       months after the start date

   Find more [55]information on supplier declarations.

Bilateral cumulation and supplier declarations

   An exporter completing a statement on origin for a product that has
   benefitted from bilateral cumulation may also need to provide a
   supplier declaration.

   For example, where a product has obtained its originating status
   through cumulating production carried out in the EU on non-originating
   materials, the exporter of those goods must get a declaration from the
   supplier of those materials.

   If you’re exporting goods to the EU for bilateral cumulation, you must
   issue a supplier declaration when each of the following applies to the
   goods:
     * they do not originate in the UK
     * they have had some UK processing carried out on them
     * they will be used by your EU customer to produce another product
       that does not meet the rules of origin for import to the UK

   If you’re importing goods from the EU for bilateral cumulation, you
   must get a supplier declaration from your EU supplier when each of the
   following applies to the goods:
     * they do not originate in the EU
     * they have had some EU processing carried out on them
     * you will use them to produce another product in the UK that meets
       the rules of origin for export to the EU

   This declaration could either be in the form set out in Annex 6
   (supplier declaration) of the [56]Trade and Cooperation Agreement or an
   equivalent document that has the same information, describing the
   non-originating materials concerned in enough detail so they can be
   identified. As with supplier declarations in the context of intra-UK
   supply chains, a supplier declaration to cover production carried out
   in the EU may be made out to cover either a single supply or regular
   supplies made over a period of time.

   Where the exported product has obtained its originating status through
   the cumulation of originating materials, the exporter must hold a
   statement on origin from the supplier based in the EU.

Record keeping requirements for a statement on origin

   An importer making a claim for preferential tariff treatment must keep
   the statement on origin made out by the exporter for 4 years from the
   date of importation.

   An exporter who has made out a statement on origin must keep, for 4
   years from the date it was made out, a copy of the statement on origin
   and all other records showing that the product satisfies the
   requirements to get originating status (for example, suppliers’
   declarations and invoices).

   In both cases, these records can be stored in an electronic format.

Multiple shipments

   A statement on origin can be made to cover multiple shipments of
   identical products supplied to a customer under the same contract over
   a 12-month period, instead of separate statements for each individual
   consignment.

   A statement on origin for multiple shipments should give the date:
     * when it is made out (date of issue)
     * of commencement of the period (start date)
     * of the end of the period (end date) — which may not be more than 12
       months after the date it was made out

   A statement on origin for multiple shipments of identical products may
   be used as a basis for claims to preferential tariff treatment accepted
   from the date of issue and covering declarations made on or between the
   start date and the end date indicated in the statement.

   The importer should keep the documents for the later consignments
   imported within the validity period for which preferential tariff
   treatment is claimed, on the basis the statement on origin for multiple
   shipments.

   The documents for later consignments do not need to have a statement on
   origin.

   A statement on origin for multiple shipments must be withdrawn by the
   exporter if the conditions for its use are no longer fulfilled. The
   withdrawal must be documented in connection with the original statement
   on origin for multiple shipments. Once the withdrawal is documented, a
   new statement on origin must be completed if the delivered products are
   again originating products.

Applying for preference using importer’s knowledge

   Read the relevant [57]Trade and Cooperation Agreement articles:
     * Cumulation of origin (article 40 on page 56 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Importer’s knowledge (article 58 on page 74 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Discrepancies (article 57 on page 74 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Record-keeping requirements (article 59 on page 75 — section 2 —
       Origin Procedures)
     * Denial of preferential Tariff treatment (article 63 on page 83 —
       section 2 — Origin Procedures)

   ‘Importer’s knowledge’ is an option that allows the importer to claim
   preferential tariff treatment based on their own knowledge about the
   originating status of imported products. It can be used as an
   alternative to a statement on origin provided by the exporter.

   As the importer is making a claim using their own knowledge, the
   exporter or producer does not need to do anything to officially state
   the originating status of the goods.

   As this option requires the importer to have knowledge that the
   products meet the relevant rules of origin, the exporter or producer
   may have to provide information about the production to the importer.
   This may be in addition to other information (such as supporting
   documents or records) which the importer may already have.

   The information could include:
     * the Harmonised System (HS) code of the product and origin criteria
       used
     * a brief description of the production process
     * if the origin criterion was based on a specific production process,
       a specific description of that process
     * if applicable, a description of the originating and non-originating
       materials used in the production process
     * if the origin criterion was ‘wholly obtained’, the applicable
       category (such as harvesting, mining, or fishing and the place of
       production)
     * if the origin criterion was based on a value method, the value of
       the product as well as the value of either all the non-originating
       or originating, or both, materials used in the production
     * if the origin criterion was based on weight, the weight of the
       product as well as the weight of either the relevant
       non-originating or originating, or both, materials used in the
       product
     * if the origin criterion was based on a change in the commodity code
       used to classify goods, a list of all the non-originating materials
       including their commodity code under the Harmonised System (in 2, 4
       or 6-digit format depending on the origin criteria)
     * the information relating to the compliance with the provision on
       non-alteration (if applicable), for example a certificate of
       non-manipulation from the Customs Authority in the country of
       transit

   If the importer cannot get the information, including when the exporter
   or producer does not provide the information because it is deemed
   commercially sensitive, preferential tariff treatment may still be
   claimed if the exporter issues a statement on origin.

   An importer making a claim for preferential tariff treatment must keep
   all records that show that the product is eligible for preference for 4
   years from the date of importation. These records may be stored in an
   electronic format.

Verification of claims for preferential treatment

   Read the relevant [58]Trade and Cooperation Agreement articles:
     * Verification (article 61 on page 78 — section 2 — Origin
       Procedures)
     * Administrative cooperation (article 62 on page 80 — section 2 —
       Origin Procedures)

   To verify if a product imported under preference is originating, the
   importing customs authority may carry out a verification. This may
   include a request for information from the importer who made the claim
   for preferential tariff treatment.

   Verification may be carried out before or after the release of the
   goods.

   If carrying out a verification before release of the goods, the customs
   authority may suspend the granting of preferential tariff treatment
   pending the results. When this happens release of the products should
   be offered to the importer, subject to a security or guarantee to cover
   the difference between the preferential and full tariff.

Claims based on a statement on origin by the exporter

   For claims based on a statement on origin made out by the exporter in
   the exporting party, verification is given in the following 2 steps.

Step 1

   The importing party’s customs authority requests the statement on
   origin from the importer. If the importer has any additional
   information supporting the fulfilment of origin criteria it can be
   provided.

   Outside of any contractual obligations between the importer and the
   exporter, there is no obligation for the exporter to provide any
   further information to the importer.

   However, if an exporter receives a request from the importer and
   prefers to give information at this stage of the verification process,
   they can do so, either to the importer or to the importing party’s
   customs authority directly.

   By giving information following the request during step 1 of the
   verification process, the exporter may avoid being asked for the
   information by their own customs authority following a request for
   administrative cooperation as part of step 2.

Step 2

   Where the importing customs authority needs to further verify the
   statement on origin or the originating status of the goods, they may
   request administrative cooperation from the customs authority in the
   exporting party.

   The exporting party’s customs authority must carry out checks on the
   exporter’s records and processes. This may involve visiting the
   exporter and confirming the goods’ eligibility to preferential tariff
   treatment in a written report back to the importing customs authority
   within 10 months of the request.

   A request for administrative cooperation is only possible when the
   claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a statement on
   origin.

Claims based on importer’s knowledge

   For claims based on importer’s knowledge, verification is given in the
   following 2 steps.

Step 1

   The importing party’s customs authority requests from the importer no
   more information than that supporting fulfilment of origin criteria,
   which is:
     * ‘wholly obtained’ — the applicable category (such as harvesting,
       mining, fishing) and place of production
     * based on change in commodity code used to classify goods — a list
       of all the non-originating materials including their commodity code
       (in 2, 4 or 6-digit format, depending on the origin criterion in
       the list rules)
     * based on a value method — the value of the final product as well as
       the value of all the non-originating materials used in the
       production
     * based on weight — the weight of the final product as well as the
       weight of the relevant non-originating materials used in the final
       product
     * based on a specific production process — a description of that
       specific process

   The importer must respond within 3 months and may add any other
   information that they consider relevant for verification.

Step 2

   Where the importing party’s customs authority needs more information to
   determine the originating status of the product and following step 1,
   they may ask the importer to give more information.

   The importing party’s customs authority cannot request administrative
   cooperation from the exporting party’s customs authority, as no
   statement on origin has been raised by the exporter. Therefore, the
   importer must be able to show that the product is originating and
   qualifies for preferential tariff treatment.

   This does not necessarily mean that all information should be easily
   available in the records of the importer at the time the claim for
   preferential tariff treatment is made, but the importer must be able to
   supply the necessary information within the time period (3 months under
   this agreement) of the request for additional information.

Denial of preferential tariff treatment

   Under specific circumstances, a claim for preferential tariff treatment
   may be denied by either party’s custom’s authority.

   A claim for preferential tariff treatment may be denied:
     * if the importer does not provide information when requested
     * where a request for verification is sent to the exporting customs
       authority and a reply is not received within 10 months
     * the verification report does not contain enough information to
       determine origin

   As long as it does not cause doubt as to the origin of the goods, a
   claim for preferential tariff treatment will not be rejected:
     * due to minor errors or discrepancies in the statement on origin
     * for the sole reason that an invoice was issued in a non-party
       country

The text of the statement on origin (Annex 7 of the Trade and Cooperation
Agreement)

   (Period: from ………………… to ………………… [59][footnote 1])

   The exporter of the products covered by this document (Exporter
   Reference Number … [60][footnote 2]) declares that, except where
   otherwise clearly indicated, these products are of … [61][footnote 3]
   preferential origin.

   …………………………………………………………… [62][footnote 4]
   (Place and date)

   ……………………………………………………………
   (Name of the exporter)

Footnotes

    1. If the statement on origin is completed for multiple shipments of
       identical originating products within the meaning of point (b) of
       Article 56 — statement on origin of the [63]Trade and Cooperation
       Agreement of this Agreement, indicate the period for which the
       statement on origin is to apply. That period shall not exceed 12
       months. All importations of the product must occur within the
       period indicated. If a period is not applicable, the field may be
       left blank.
    2. Indicate the reference number by which the exporter is identified.
       For the Union exporter, this will be the number assigned in
       accordance with the laws and regulations of the Union. For the
       United Kingdom exporter, this will be the number assigned in
       accordance with the laws and regulations applicable within the
       United Kingdom. Where the exporter has not been assigned a number,
       this field may be left blank.
    3. Indicate the origin of the product: the United Kingdom or the
       Union.
    4. Place and date may be omitted if the information is contained on
       the document itself.

What Is a Fiduciary Duty?

   Fiduciary duty refers to the relationship between a fiduciary and the
   principal or beneficiary on whose behalf the fiduciary acts.

   The fiduciary accepts legal responsibility for duties of care, loyalty,
   good faith, confidentiality, and more when serving the best interests
   of a beneficiary. Strict care must be taken to ensure that
   no [169]conflict of interest arises to jeopardize those interests.

Key Takeaways

     * A fiduciary duty involves actions taken in the best interests of
       another person or entity.
     * Fiduciary duty describes the relationship between an attorney and a
       client or a guardian and a ward.
     * Fiduciary duties include duty of care, loyalty, good faith,
       confidentiality, prudence, and disclosure.
     * It has been successfully argued that an employee may have a
       fiduciary duty of loyalty to an employer.
     * A breach of fiduciary duty occurs when a fiduciary fails to act
       responsibly in the best interests of a client.

Examples of Fiduciary Relationships

Trustee/Beneficiary

   A single parent with young children might create a trust to administer
   the assets that the children would inherit should the parent die while
   the children are still underage.

   In this case, the parent will name a person or an entity, such as a law
   firm or bank, as trustee of the [170]estate. That person or entity has
   a fiduciary duty to the children, who are the beneficiaries of the
   estate.

   In a trustee/beneficiary relationship, the fiduciary (trustee) has
   legal ownership of the property and controls the assets held in the
   trust.

   As fiduciary, the trustee must make decisions that are in the best
   interest of the beneficiary as the latter holds equitable title to
   the [171]property.

   The trustee/beneficiary relationship is an important aspect of
   comprehensive [172]estate planning. Special care should be taken to
   determine who is designated as trustee.

Guardian/Ward

   In a guardian/ward relationship, an adult is designated as the legal
   guardian of a minor child. The guardian, as the fiduciary, is tasked
   with ensuring that all matters related to the daily welfare of the
   child are dealt with responsibly and in the best interests of the
   child. This care can include such things as deciding where the child
   will attend school, arranging for health care, and providing an
   allowance.

   A guardian may be appointed by a state court when a parent dies or is
   unable to care for the child for other reasons. In most states, the
   guardian/ward relationship remains intact until the minor child reaches
   adulthood.

Agent/Principal

   Any person, corporation, partnership, or government agency might be
   called upon to act as agent without conflict of interest on behalf of a
   principal.

   A common example of [173]an agent/principal relationship that implies
   fiduciary duty is that between the executives of a company and its
   shareholders. The shareholders expect that the executives will make
   well-considered, prudent decisions on their behalf and in their best
   interests as owners.

   A similar fiduciary relationship exists between personal investors and
   the [174]fund managers they select to manage their assets.

Attorney/Client

   The agreement between an attorney and a client is arguably one of the
   most stringent of fiduciary relationships.

   The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that the highest level of trust and
   confidence must exist between an attorney and a client. An attorney, as
   a fiduciary, must act with fairness, loyalty, care, and within the law
   on behalf of the client.

   Attorneys can be sued for breaches of their fiduciary duties by
   clients. They are accountable to the court in which a client is
   represented when a breach occurs.

Controlling Stockholder/Company

   In certain circumstances, fiduciary duties may be required of a
   stockholder who possesses a majority interest in a corporation or who
   exercises control over its activities. A breach of fiduciary duty may
   result in personal legal liability for the controlling shareholder as
   well as directors and officers.

   The adjective fiduciary means held or given in trust. A fiduciary
   commits to acting in the best interests of a principal or beneficiary.

Types of Fiduciary Duties

   Fiduciary duties may differ depending on the type of beneficiary that a
   fiduciary serves. However, in general, the legal and ethical
   obligations related to protecting the interests of beneficiaries
   include the following duties.

Duty of Care

   This is the responsibility to inform oneself as completely as possible
   in order to exercise sound judgments that protect a beneficiary's
   interests. It can involve the thoughtful consideration of options and
   sensible decision-making that's based on a careful examination of
   available information.

Duty of Loyalty

   This pertains to acting in the best interest of the beneficiary at all
   times, putting their well-being first and foremost. It includes the
   duty of the fiduciary to excuse themself from taking actions when
   there's a conflict of interest with the beneficiary's welfare.

Duty of Good Faith

   This duty pertains to always acting within the law to advance the
   interests of the beneficiary. At no time should the fiduciary take
   actions that are outside of legal constraints.

Duty of Confidentiality

   A fiduciary must maintain the confidentiality of all information
   relating to the beneficiary. They must not use any form of it, whether
   written or spoken, for their personal gain.

Duty of Prudence

   Fiduciaries must administer matters and make decisions concerning the
   interests of beneficiaries with the highest degree of professional
   skill, caution, and critical awareness of risk.

Duty to Disclose

   Fiduciaries must engage in completely forthright behavior, disclosing
   any and all relevant information that could have an impact on their
   ability to carry out their duties as fiduciary and/or on the well-being
   of a beneficiary's interests.

Breaches in Fiduciary Duty

   Fiduciary duties are taken on by individuals and entities for various
   types of beneficiaries. Such relationships include, among others,
   lawyers acting for clients, company executives acting for stockholders,
   guardians acting for their wards, [175]financial advisers acting for
   investors, and trustees acting for estate beneficiaries.

   An employee may even have a fiduciary duty to an employer. That is,
   employers have a right to expect that employees are acting in their
   best interests. For example, they are not sharing trade secrets, or
   using company equipment for private purposes, or stealing customers
   from a competitor.

   These expectations may not be actual fiduciary duties but they may be
   spelled out in an employee handbook or contract clause.

   Case law indicates that breaches of fiduciary duty most often happen
   when a binding fiduciary relationship is in effect and actions are
   taken which violate or are counterproductive to the interests of a
   specific beneficiary.

   Typically, the inappropriate actions are alleged to have benefitted the
   fiduciary's interests or the interests of a third party instead of a
   principal's or beneficiary's interests. In some cases, a breach stems
   from a fiduciary's failure to provide important information to a
   client, which leads to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, or
   misguided advice.

   Disclosure of any potential conflict of interest is important in a
   fiduciary relationship because any conflict can be seen as a cause for
   a breach of trust.

Consequences of a Fiduciary Breach

   A breach of fiduciary duty can lead to a number of consequences. Not
   all of them are legal consequences.
    1. An accusation of a breach of fiduciary duty can hurt the reputation
       of a professional. A client can end a professional relationship
       because they do not trust in [176]a professional’s care of the
       required fiduciary duty.
    2. If a breach of duty case proceeds to the courts, steeper
       consequences can result. A successful breach of fiduciary duty
       lawsuit can result in monetary penalties for direct damages,
       indirect damages, and legal costs.
    3. A court ruling can also lead to industry discrediting, the loss of
       a license, or removal from service.

   However, proving a breach of fiduciary duty is not always easy.

Elements of a Fiduciary Breach Claim

   A number of legal precedents and elements have been established to
   allow claims by those who have been harmed by a breach of fiduciary
   duty. Jurisdictions differ, but in general, the following four elements
   are essential if a plaintiff is to prevail in a breach of fiduciary
   duty claim.

A Duty Existed

   The plaintiff must show that a legal fiduciary duty existed. Many
   professionals are obligated, legally and ethically, to conduct their
   businesses honestly. However, that doesn't mean that they are
   fiduciaries who must act solely in the interest of a particular client.
   A fiduciary duty is accepted as such by a fiduciary, typically in
   writing.

A Breach Occurred

   The plaintiff must show that a fiduciary duty was breached. The type of
   breach varies in every case. For example, if an accountant was sloppy
   in filling out a client's tax returns, and the client was slapped with
   an enormous fine for nonpayment, the accountant may be guilty of a
   breach of fiduciary duty. However, if the client was sloppy and failed
   to provide complete and necessary information, no breach occurred.

Damage Was Sustained

   The plaintiff must show that the breach of trust caused actual damage.
   Without damage, there is usually no basis for a breach of fiduciary
   duty case. The more specific a principal or beneficiary can be with
   facts of damage, the better.

   For example, a trustee might be sued for selling a beneficiary's
   property too cheaply. If the buyer is a relative of the trustee, it's
   clearly a conflict of interest. However, a specific accounting relating
   to the loss to the beneficiary is needed to prove a breach of fiduciary
   duty.

Causation Was Proved

   Causation shows that any damages incurred by the plaintiff were
   directly linked with the actions taken in breach of fiduciary duty. In
   the above example of a property sale, the link appears to be clear.
   However, the trustee might argue that a quick sale was in the best
   interest of the beneficiary and that no other buyer was interested.

   If you suspect your [177]financial adviser is in breach of their
   fiduciary duty, you can file a complaint with [178]FINRA, the [179]SEC,
   or both. If your adviser has a professional certification, you can also
   notify the entity that provided the credential.

Examples of Fiduciary Breach Cases

A Duty of Loyalty

   One example of a breach in fiduciary duty case went to the Virginia
   Supreme Court in 2007.

   In "Banks v. Mario Industries of Virginia, Inc." a lighting
   manufacturer and supplier sued a former employee for establishing a
   directly competing business by allegedly using proprietary information
   acquired in their previous employment.

   The manufacturer did not require its employees to sign a non-compete or
   confidentiality clause, although the company handbook outlined related
   policies.

   In this case, the question of whether the employees had a fiduciary
   duty to their former employer, and breached it, was fundamental to the
   appeal that brought the case to the state's highest court.

   The court affirmed the lower court's ruling that the employees owed
   Mario a duty of loyalty. In effect, it supported the claim of a breach
   of fiduciary duty, and a penalty of more than $1 million.

A Menswear Store vs. Ex-Employees

   In 2006, a high-end menswear store cited a breach of fiduciary duty
   when it sued two of its former sales professionals for taking a job
   with a competitor, Saks Fifth Avenue. The department store was able to
   prove that it suffered actual losses after the salesmen left.

   However, the court ruled that the losses could not be attributed
   directly to the actions of its former employees. The suit failed.

Aiding and Abetting a Breach of Duty

   A comptroller for a corporation embezzled $15 million from his employer
   by writing checks against his company's bank account and depositing
   them into another account at his own bank.

   The company sued the bank that took the deposits, alleging that it
   aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty. The court ruled that
   there was insufficient evidence that the bank was aware of its role in
   the scam.

What Does It Mean to Have a Fiduciary Duty?

   The adjective fiduciary means held or given in trust. In accepting a
   fiduciary duty, an individual or entity accepts a legal commitment to
   act in the best interests of a beneficiary.

What Are the Main Fiduciary Duties?

   There are several types of fiduciary duties. One is the duty of loyalty
   which implies that the fiduciary will always act in the best interests
   of the beneficiary or principal. Duty of care is another. It means that
   a fiduciary will take special care to make sound, sensible decisions
   regarding a beneficiary's well-being. No conflicting interest will be
   permitted to influence the fiduciary's actions on behalf of the client.
   Duty to disclose is a third. It refers to the duty a fiduciary has to
   disclose any conflict of interest they may have when acting on behalf
   of a beneficiary.

What Are Some Examples of Fiduciary Relationships?

   The most common fiduciary relationships involve legal or financial
   professionals who agree to act on behalf of their clients. For example,
   a lawyer and a client have a fiduciary relationship. So do a trustee
   and a beneficiary, a corporate board and its shareholders, and an agent
   acting for a principal.

   However, any individual may, in some cases, have a fiduciary duty to
   another person or entity. For example, an employee may be found to have
   a duty of loyalty to an employer and may be legally liable if they
   cause harm to the employer by misusing information or resources
   entrusted to them.

What Does It Mean to Be a Fiduciary?

   A fiduciary is entrusted with the authority to act on behalf of another
   person or entity and has the legal and ethical obligation to act in the
   best interest of them. A fiduciary agrees to put a beneficiary's
   interest above their own.

The Bottom Line

   Fiduciary duties refer to the ways that a fiduciary is legally
   committed to act for a principal or beneficiary. They include a duty of
   loyalty, a duty of care, a duty of prudence, a duty of confidentiality,
   and more.

   Fiduciary duties are meant to ensure that the fiduciary acts only in
   the best interests of a principal or beneficiary. What's more, the
   fiduciary must act diligently to protect those interests.

   While you should always expect a high standard of care from a
   fiduciary, you can protect yourself by understanding the rights that
   this relationship grants you and the responsibilities that are [180]not
   part of a fiduciary's duties.

Overview

   The Equality Act 2010 legally protects people from discrimination in
   the workplace and in wider society.

   It replaced previous anti-discrimination laws with a single Act, making
   the law easier to understand and strengthening protection in some
   situations. It sets out the different ways in which it’s unlawful to
   treat someone.

   Find out more about [50]who is protected from discrimination, [51]the
   types of discrimination under the law and [52]what action you can take
   if you feel you’ve been unfairly discriminated against.

Discrimination: making a complaint

   Before the Act came into force there were several pieces of legislation
   to cover discrimination, including:
     * Sex Discrimination Act 1975
     * Race Relations Act 1976
     * Disability Discrimination Act 1995

   If you wish to complain about possible unlawful treatment there are 2
   separate processes, depending on when it happened.

Complaints: before October 2010

   If you were subjected to unlawful treatment (eg discrimination,
   harassment or victimisation) before 1 October 2010, the Equality Act
   won’t apply. Instead, you’ll be covered by the legislation that was in
   force at the time.

   For example, if you experienced race discrimination on 30 September
   2010 and want to make a complaint or bring legal proceedings, the Race
   Relations Act 1976 will apply, not the Equality Act.

   This is also true of any legal proceedings. They will go ahead
   according to the legislation under which they were brought, even if
   they may have continued after 1 October 2010.

       previous legislation

Complaints: after October 2010

   If you were subject to unlawful treatment on or after 1 October 2010,
   the Equality Act applies.

   For example, if you experienced sex discrimination on 30 September
   2010, which continued until 2 October 2010, the Equality Act will
   apply, not the Sex Discrimination Act.

   [54]Discrimination: your rights guide.

Equality Act provisions: commencement dates

   To allow people and organisations enough time to prepare for the new
   laws, the provisions of the Act were brought in at different times
   (known as commencement dates).

October 2010

   Equality Act provisions which came into force on 1 October 2010:
     * the basic framework of protection against direct and indirect
       discrimination, harassment and victimisation in services and public
       functions, premi, work, education, associations and transport
     * changing the definition of gender reassignment, by removing the
       requirement for medical supervision
     * providing protection for people discriminated against because they
       are perceived to have, or are associated with someone who has, a
       protected characteristic
     * clearer protection for breastfeeding mothers
     * applying a uniform definition of indirect discrimination to all
       protected characteristics
     * harmonising provisions allowing voluntary positive action

Provisions relating to disability

     * extending protection against indirect discrimination to disability
     * introducing the concept of “discrimination arising from disability”
       to replace protection under previous legislation lost as a result
       of a legal judgment
     * applying the detriment model to victimisation protection (aligning
       with the approach in employment law)
     * harmonising the thresholds for the duty to make reasonable
       adjustments for disabled people
     * extending protection against harassment of employees by third
       parties to all protected characteristics
     * making it more difficult for disabled people to be unfairly
       screened out when applying for jobs, by restricting the
       circumstances in which employers can ask job applicants questions
       about disability or health

Provisions relating to work

     * allowing claims for direct gender pay discrimination where there is
       no actual comparator
     * making pay secrecy clauses unenforceable
     * extending protection in private clubs to sex, religion or belief,
       pregnancy and maternity, and gender reassignment
     * introducing new powers for employment tribunals to make
       recommendations which benefit the wider workforce

April 2011

   Equality Act provisions which came into force in April 2011:
     * positive action - recruitment and promotion
     * public sector Equality Duty (see section below)

   Ministers are considering how to implement the remaining provisions in
   the best way for business and for others with rights and
   responsibilities under the act. Their decisions will be announced in
   due course.

   Equality Act Provisions that the government has decided not to take
   forward:
     * public sector duty regarding socio-economic inequalities
     * combined discrimination - dual characteristics

Age discrimination

   The Equality Act 2010 includes provisions that ban age discrimination
   against adults in the provision of services and public functions. The
   ban came into force on 1 October 2012 and it is now unlawful to
   discriminate on the basis of age unless:
     * the practice is covered by an exception from the ban
     * good reason can be shown for the differential treatment (‘objective
       justification’)

   The ban on age discrimination is designed to ensure that the new law
   prohibits only harmful treatment that results in genuinely unfair
   discrimination because of age. It does not outlaw the many instances of
   different treatment that are justifiable or beneficial.

   You can read the original consultation on the [55]archived Government
   Equalities Office website.

   There is an overview of how the ban works and tailored guides for small
   businesses, private clubs and the holiday sector in the [56]Equality
   Act guidance.

Age discrimination: exceptions

   The [57]government response to the consultation includes the draft
   Exceptions Order. You can also read the [58]impact assessment.

   Exceptions under the Order are:
     * age-based concessions
     * age-related holidays
     * age verification
     * clubs and associations concessions
     * financial services
     * immigration
     * residential park homes
     * sport

   These specific exceptions are in addition to:
     * general exceptions already allowed by the Act
     * positive action measures
     * ‘objective justification’

   There are no specific exceptions to the ban on age discrimination for
   health or social care services. This means that any age-based practices
   by the NHS and social care organisations need to be objectively
   justified, if challenged.

Public sector Equality Duty

   The [59]public sector Equality Duty came into force across Great
   Britain on 5 April 2011. It means that public bodies have to consider
   all individuals when carrying out their day-to-day work – in shaping
   policy, in delivering services and in relation to their own employees.

   It also requires that public bodies have due regard to the need to:
     * eliminate discrimination
     * advance equality of opportunity
     * foster good relations between different people when carrying out
       their activities

Who the Equality Duty applies to

   The Equality Duty applies across Great Britain to the public bodies
   [60]listed in Schedule 19 (as amended), and to any other organisation
   when it is carrying out a public function.

Specific duties

   The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) Regulations 2011 came into
   force on 10 September 2011.

   The specific duties require public bodies to publish relevant,
   proportionate information showing compliance with the Equality Duty,
   and to set equality objectives.

Guidance for public bodies

   The Government Equalities Office has published 2 quick-start guides to
   help public bodies understand the Equality Duty and the specific
   duties:
     * [61]Quick start guide: public sector Equality Duty
     * [62]Quick start guide: Specific duties

   The [63]Equality and Human Rights Commission is the statutory body
   established to help eliminate discrimination and reduce inequality. The
   Commission has published new non-statutory guidance on:
     * [64]The essential guide to the public sector Equality Duty
     * [65]Meeting the Equality Duty in policy and decision-making
     * [66]Engagement and the Equality Duty
     * [67]Equality objectives and the Equality Duty
     * [68]Equality information and the Equality Duty
     * [69]Technical guidance on the public sector Equality Duty - England

Devolution

   Section 153 of the act enables the Welsh and Scottish ministers to
   impose specific duties on certain Welsh and Scottish public bodies
   through secondary legislation. For Welsh and cross-border Welsh public
   bodies, specific duties have been finalised by the Welsh Assembly
   government and came into force on 6 April 2011.

   [70]The Equality Act 2010 (Statutory Duties) (Wales) Regulations 2011

   For Scottish public bodies, the Scottish government launched a
   consultation on revised draft Regulations for specific duties on 9
   September 2011. The consultation closed on 25 November 2011.

   [1]Political Philosophy

   Democracy and Political Obligation

   Herman van Erp
   Tilburg University
   [2]H.H.H.vErp@kub.nl

     ABSTRACT: The public life of political servants is characterized by
     other duties and obligations than private life. Conflicts can even
     arise between a person's public and private duties. The central
     point of this paper is to examine whether this difference of duties
     can be regarded as an effect of different forms of obligation. Can
     we speak of a particular form of political obligation in the same
     way in which Kant distinguishes between ethical and legal
     obligation, the former pertaining to intentions and the latter to
     external aspects of the action? Could political obligation be
     distinguished from both of them, for example by its relation towards
     ends? The first section develops the thesis that if there is such a
     thing as political necessity, it must be some kind of moral
     obligation. The second section focuses on the question of whether
     political obligation can be conceived of as different from legal and
     ethical obligation, the only two forms of moral obligation that Kant
     distinguishes. The last section is about a differentiated conception
     of political obligation and virtue, in democracies, for political
     leaders, for citizens, and for public servants.

                          bluered.gif (1041 bytes)

   All modern societies in some way accept the distinction between legal
   and ethical obligation. The former constitutes an exterior sphere of
   norms and rules, including duties which citizens can be compelled to
   perform by the threat of punishment or other legal consequences, the
   latter concerns the interior sphere of a person's conscience and
   private intentions. Making this distinction can be seen as the explicit
   acknowledgement of what Agnes Heller has called 'the first structural
   change in morals': the evolution of a separate subjective sphere of
   morality within the public ethical life. (1) Legal and moral law oblige
   in different ways and also contain different duties. In modern society,
   legal duties usually take the form of commands and rules. The
   distinguishing characteristic of legal duties and corresponding rights
   is that they can be enforced by an appeal to the law. For the sake of
   certainty and to avoid arbitrariness, the legal system strives to
   formulate duties as unambiguously, completely and consistently as
   possible, and to determine the rules for their enforcement precisely.
   Thus, the question of what a legal obligation is and how the subjects
   under obligation must behave is virtually answered by the legal system
   itself. How to fulfill a moral duty, on the other hand, is considered a
   matter of ethical obligation and left to the conscience of private
   persons. Immanuel Kant thought that the domain of duties could be
   adequately divided into duties that can be the object of legal
   obligation, on the one hand, and duties that only can be the object of
   ethical obligation, on the other. The latter pertains to intentions;
   the former, to external aspects of the action. I think, however, that
   there are good reasons for also distinguishing a domain of political
   obligation that is not reducible to either legal or ethical obligation.
   Political obligation must be distinguished from both of the former
   categories because it allows, in exceptional circumstances, illegal
   means in order to safeguard political ends. This political violence
   cannot simply be legitimized by the principle that urgent need goes
   before the law, but must be based on a more positive principle. I think
   the same principle lies at the base of the legitimation of democratic
   or republican revolutions. In the first section of this article, the
   thesis is developed that if there is such a thing as political
   necessity, it must be some form of moral obligation. In the second, the
   concept of political obligation is clarified as being different from
   ethical and legal obligation. In the third, a connection is made
   between political obligation and democratic political virtue.

   1. Moral duty and political necessity

   Machiavelli is the most famous political theorist to argue that, in the
   field of political action, there is something like a political
   necessity that can override moral norms or obligations. From a moral
   point of view, it is not acceptable to legitimize immoral politics. But
   is this Machiavelli's intention? The possible immoral actions of the
   prince, such as murder of his political opponents, cruelty against his
   subjects, violation of treaties, are neither approved nor excused by
   Machiavelli. The question whether a politician has to act in a way that
   is not in accordance with moral norms is always set in the special
   context of historical examples in his works. No general legitimation or
   permission for immoral actions is given. There seems only to be a form
   of inevitability under special circumstances. In the large majority of
   cases of immoral behaviour mentioned by Machiavelli, however, this
   inevitability appears to be the result of wrong calculations. We could
   suppose that, even in Machiavelli's view, the inevitability of an
   immoral action can never be known as a real necessity. So-called
   political necessity is itself always a concept used within the strategy
   of the political power game. There is no objective necessity that, as
   an external constraint, forces the politician to act immorally, nor is
   there any rule or knowledge that would commit him to such an action.
   This seems logical because, if there really were an objective necessity
   under special circumstances to kill someone or to commit any other
   crime, or if a statesman with a sense of responsibility knew himself to
   be obliged to commit such actions, these actions could not be
   considered in any sense immoral. If the concept of political necessity
   can have a legitimation function for actions that seem to be morally
   reprehensible, this concept must be linked to a concept of political
   responsibility and obligation.

   Such renowned moral philosophers as Michael Walzer and, though more
   hesitantly, Thomas Nagel and Bernard Williams, seem to accept that
   political necessity can cause the paradox that responsible politicians
   must get their hands dirty and commit moral crimes. (2) From a Kantian
   moral point of view, there can be no other necessity for free human
   actions than moral necessity. If this is the right conception, as I
   believe it is, we cannot justly speak of moral paradoxes. The evil that
   necessarily would have to be done cannot be morally wrong, because it
   would be the object of a political obligation. On this point, I must
   agree with Nielsen's criticism of the ideas of the previously mentioned
   authors, with respect to the dirty hands dilemma. (3) But I cannot
   agree with the background of his ethical theory, which is an example of
   a consequentialism that must lead to the principle that in politics the
   ends sanctify the means.

   The difference between private and public morality is not a question of
   different principles, but a question of their application under
   different circumstances. Political circumstances generally make it
   impossible or irresponsible to solely appeal to one's good intentions
   while remaining passive and inert. In politics, there is always some
   urgency for action or decision and politics, therefore, needs a concept
   of particular ends by which its actions and decisions can be
   legitimized. Political necessities are causal factors in the
   realisation of these ends. The concept of necessity belongs to the
   interpretative definition of the circumstances under which positive
   moral principles and values have to be applied. But political
   necessities cannot remove the strict necessity of categorical moral
   prohibitions. Political leaders have an obligation to translate the
   concept of a political community into concrete political ends and the
   means for their realisation. As causal factors between means and ends,
   political necessities are themselves part of these translations.
   Precisely because politicians have to think in these categories of
   political ends, means and necessities, they are exposed to the risk of
   considering moral constraints as only one of the impediments to their
   possible actions. The concept of political necessity involves the
   inclination of transgressing moral limits as if this transgression was
   the clearing away of an obstacle. Therefore, Thomas Nagel is right when
   he states: 'One of the hardest lines to draw in public policy is the
   one that defines where the ends stop justifying the means. If results
   were the only basis for public morality then it would be possible to
   justify anything, including torture and massacre, in the service of
   sufficiently large interests.' (4) It is the political body as a whole,
   the democratic society, that has to draw and safeguard this line.

   2. The character of political obligation

   Morality puts particular limits on actions that may not be
   transgressed, even for the most desirable public ends. Nevertheless, in
   the domain of the morality of public life, it seems more important to
   take responsibility for the realisation of ends than in private life,
   the morality of which is mainly characterised by feelings and
   intentions. The limits placed on the actions of private individuals are
   more stringent than those put on the actions of representatives of the
   state. Private persons are prohibited from encroaching on the rights of
   others for the sake of their own well-being. The state, on the other
   hand, sometimes has a right to encroach on private life and the rights
   of one individual for the benefit of others or because of its own
   interests. Its servants may even use ruthless means that would be
   unacceptable in private life. Although the ultimate criteria for what
   is morally good and wrong are the same for both public and private life
   and these domains are not governed by different moral principles, the
   public life of political servants is characterised by other duties than
   those of the individual in private life. There can even be particular
   conflicts between a person's public and private duties. Can this
   difference of duties be regarded as an effect of different forms of
   obligation?

   There is an analytical connection between duty and obligation.
   Obligation often has the same meaning as duty. To be obliged means to
   have a duty. An obligation can also be the act of obliging oneself or
   someone else. In that case, a duty is the conception of some behaviour
   as the object of an obligation. Generally, we can say that people are
   obliged to perform their duty. Determining the grounds on which this
   general obligation is founded ultimately is a difficult philosophical
   question. But is seems clear that there cannot be an obligation without
   a will imposing a duty or an obliging will. The person or entity that
   imposes an obligation is called the author and the obliged person is
   the subject of the obligation. From the point of view of their origins,
   we can distinguish between different forms of obligation. One can
   oblige oneself, so that the same person is both the subject and the
   author of the obligation in the form of an autonomous moral will. In
   the case of legal obligation, which can be enforced by an external
   authority, we are obliged by the will of another person: the lawgiver
   as the author of the obligation. To the extent that a moral duty cannot
   be enforced by an external authority, the moral necessity has the
   character of an ethical obligation. A moral duty, therefore, can be the
   object of either legal or ethical obligation.

   Many political theories consider political obligation to be the
   obligation of citizens to obey the laws and commands of the state. (5)
   Under normal circumstances, all citizens ought to behave in conformity
   with their conscientious interpretation of the law. This obligation to
   obey can be understood as a moral duty, the explanation of which does
   not need a special conception of political obligation, as distinct from
   legal or ethical obligation. This seems true as long as the state does
   not ask of its citizens an extraordinary readiness to make sacrifices
   or to take special responsibilities. But political obligation is also
   associated with a duty to defend your country, to fight for justice
   and, particularly in war, even to risk your own life. These duties
   cannot always be seen as supererogatory, because under particular
   circumstances citizens and politicians are forced to behave in
   conformity with these requirements. Political necessity is a form of
   external coercion and, therefore, different from moral necessity, but
   it is also different from legal enforcement.

   It seems possible and relevant to make a distinction between the
   citizens' ethical and legal obligation to obey the laws of a political
   system, on the one hand, and political obligation in a stricter and
   particular sense, on the other. In the domain of political action,
   there seems to be a need for obligations that cannot be left to the
   interior sphere of the conscience of private persons, nor reduced to
   legal enforcement. An obvious reason is the problem that, outside an
   existing legitimized political system, there is no legal right to
   enforce laws. In those situations, too, it must be possible to
   establish, eventually by force, a system of law and political order.
   Traditionally, the right to impose a political order and to subject
   people to a positive law is legitimized by mythical and religious
   representations, or by an appeal to natural right. Kant deduces
   political obligation totally from the concept of law. He thinks that we
   can make a 'construction' of the concept of right by imagining a system
   of continuous reciprocal constraint which upholds the freedom of all in
   accordance with general laws. (6) But the concept of legal enforcement
   provides only a formal determination of public law. It does not say
   anything about who has a right to enforce which laws with respect to
   which ends. We can imagine numerous systems of rules that could be
   externally enforced in a general way. Therefore, the concept of legal
   obligation alone can neither protect society against political
   disagreement, despotism and totalitarianism, nor provide a more
   substantial conception of public interest. There is a necessity to
   create political structures that both allow for normative social
   decisions and protect the freedom of citizens, a necessity that cannot
   be conceived of as a system of totally external enforcement. The
   solution to this problem, of how to establish a legitimized political
   order, may not be left to the private moral will of the political
   leaders. The creation or reconstruction of a just political system is
   an obligation that also cannot be enforced legally. Nevertheless, it
   seems to allow for some other kind of enforcement, which is called the
   will of the people, that even can take the form of rebellion and
   violence. But the will of the people as such, without democratic
   political structures, is just a mythological concept.

   People have a collective obligation to join a political community in
   which they subject themselves to a public law without losing their
   freedom. For the isolated individuals as such, this cannot be more than
   the ethical obligation to be willing to accept an external authority
   imposing legal rules. Within a given public legal order, this ethical
   obligation has been transformed into the legal obligation to respect
   positive law. In a state of anarchy, in a civil war, or in a state of
   nature, it is unclear how this ethical obligation has to be translated
   into concrete actions of obedience. It is only certain that we may not
   prevent the institution of a public order or make the existing legal
   system totally powerless. Under these exceptional circumstances, the
   collective duty, which only implies an ethical obligation for
   individuals, bestows a right on some individuals to take the initiative
   to impose a public order on others or, without the support of valid
   law, to enforce some changes in a given, but unjust, political order.
   In a state of public injustice, specific individuals who feel
   responsible for the public benefit have a right to exert a form of
   political violence that is not yet, or not any longer, in accordance
   with the legally defined and monopolised official mode of exerting
   political power. This is not a case of ethical obligation alone because
   the duty which is the object of political obligation can in some way be
   enforced by the people, either by legal, or by particularly political
   means such as refusal, resistance, and even revolt. In a democratic
   constitution, the right or obligation of citizens to revolt against
   injustices committed by the state can, pace Kant, legally be
   acknowledged, as the constitutions of some states of the German Federal
   Republic show. (7)

   Thus, political obligation seems to be a kind of obligation concerning
   the duties of political leaders and citizens together who, as a
   collectivity, are responsible for the political system as a whole. The
   domain of political obligation is situated between ethics and law. The
   moral worth of an action is primarily determined by the intentions of
   its agent, and the agent is only morally responsible for the effects of
   his action insofar as he can be considered a free cause of these
   effects and they could reasonably be foreseen. But a political agent
   will not be praised as a good politician only because his or her
   political actions are morally just or in perfect conformity with the
   law. Agents in the public service are supposed to exert themselves in
   favour of the public interest. Therefore, political responsibility
   requires not only the performance of correct actions, but also a will
   to uphold and improve the political system and a desire to perform
   successfully where the right action is not prescribed by law. This
   requirement of special political attitudes connects the concept of
   political responsibility with that of moral obligation and virtue. In
   cases of political responsibility, however, it is not good intentions
   but the results of the action which appear to count as the right
   criterion for its evaluation. From a purely political point of view,
   persons are judged mainly with respect to the external effects of their
   actions. Consequentialism seems an essential characteristic of
   political ethics, although it cannot provide ultimate criteria for
   moral judgement. (8)

   3. Political responsibility and democratic leadership

   Generally, I would say that citizens in a free democratic, or
   republican, political system have - even if there is no legal
   obligation - a political obligation to vote or to express in other ways
   their contentment or discontent with the policy of their government.
   Being a citizen in a democratic country is a privilege that, like
   nobility, obliges a person to develop political virtue and the
   willingness to assume, to some degree, political responsibility. A
   political leader with a great sense of responsibility for national
   interests and the safety of the state will feel obliged to do things
   that go far beyond the moral duties and rights of private persons in
   daily life. Taking great responsibilities is a praiseworthy thing in
   people who have the capacities to take them. Political merit
   presupposes some ingenuity in devising political goals and means and
   also the ability and courage to implement them. But under complex and
   uncertain circumstances, the real outcomes of political decisions and
   actions are often not predictable. The politician has to take risks. He
   will be praised when fortune favours him and blamed when it is against
   him. Good political actions seem to be much more determined by external
   contingencies than moral choice and virtue are. Therefore, it is
   rational that politicians can legally dispose of special means and
   powers to advance their purposes and to prevent or correct undesirable
   effects. This particular responsibility means a moral burden for the
   political agent, which is to a degree compensated by personal
   advantages such as a high income, privileges, and personal and social
   status. Most politicians enjoy the special power and status connected
   with their responsibility. Many politicians seem to strive for
   political positions because of these personal advantages. Political
   power, status, and privileges can easily be employed for the personal
   benefits of friends and family. To avoid corruption and unfair
   benefiting, the obligations of public offices must be clearly defined.

   Public servants have an official duty to do what the legal political
   system wants. They have this duty insofar as they themselves are a
   functional part of the system. This functional relationship is not
   characterised by what I would call a lien of political obligation,
   because its duties are defined by formal rules and legal obligation.
   The duty to perform their tasks in a formally prescribed impersonal and
   detached manner relieves civil servants of too many burdensome moral
   worries. But an excessive devotion to formal duty can also make
   officials blind to other moral requirements. Of course, corruption is
   objectionable. But our focus on corruption must not lead us to forget
   that a state can commit injustice through its most loyal servants. The
   public servant gets in touch with political obligation when, as a
   responsible citizen, he has to decide how far he has to adapt the
   execution of his formal tasks to the particular ends of the ruling
   party. Sometimes it will be relevant for him to make a political
   choice. The urgency to make political choices will be more frequent and
   less inevitable as the public servant occupies more leading and guiding
   positions or functions that are sensitive to political manipulation.
   Public servants in such positions are politically answerable for the
   choices they make or forsake to make. As stated previously, political
   obligation is connected with the notion of 'noblesse oblige'.
   Therefore, it appears reasonable that officials in leading positions
   can be held politically responsible for the effects of the political
   choices that they have made or have refused to make. How a person has
   to choose is determined by moral judgement, but the fact that he has to
   choose is a question of political obligation and courage.

   Leaders and citizens of rich and mighty nations have political
   responsibilities that go far beyond the security and well-being of
   their own nation-states. They have responsibilities to translate
   ethical obligations for global justice into adequate legal rules and
   economic measures. It is not unjust that people of other countries try
   to find political means by which they can induce the rich nations to
   take their responsibilities seriously. Today, many complaints can be
   heard about the deficiency of political leadership on the global level.
   Political leaders are said not to be active enough in stopping the
   massacres in African countries, or in finding solutions for the wars in
   eastern Europe and Asia. They are said to neglect their political
   responsibilities for lack of political courage. It is easy to utter
   such moral complaints, but it is not so easy to determine, within the
   contemporary situation of post-Cold War politics, what calling up
   political leaders to show courage requires of them. Demanding political
   courage in the abstract can be dangerous when connected with the
   widespread prejudice that mass democracy slackens the sense of moral
   responsibility and is an impediment to political courage.

   Democratic decision procedures are no obstacle to leadership. On the
   contrary, democracy has to be learned and requires continuous
   attentiveness. Leadership plays an important role in democracy, but it
   cannot be formalised into a command system with a descending order of
   subordination like the army or bureaucratic organisations. A democratic
   leader not only has to justify his political ends and actions to his
   fellow citizens, but he must also take political responsibility for
   promoting, within his own society, a moral sense of the value of
   democratic answerability. Democratic political virtue is allergic to
   utopian conceptions of political heroism and leadership. Democracy
   obliges leaders as well as citizens to develop more communicative
   political virtues and to be inventive in the search for other political
   means than enforcement by war and violence. In this concept of
   political virtue, a conception of political leadership that inclines
   towards a disapproval of democracy because it is too soft and thus
   unfit for the harshness of political necessities does is no longer
   suitable.

   The Consumer Duty will set higher and clearer standards of consumer
   protection across financial services and require firms to act to
   deliver good outcomes for customers. We set out here the findings from
   our review of firms’ plans to embed the Duty within their businesses.

1. Why we conducted this review

   In July 2022, we set out the [141]final rules and [142]guidance for a
   new Consumer Duty. The Consumer Duty is a cornerstone of our three-year
   strategy and a key element of our work to set and test higher
   standards.

   The rules and guidance we are introducing come into force on a phased
   basis:
     * for new and existing products or services that are open to sale or
       renewal the rules come into force on 31 July 2023
     * for closed products or services, the rules come into force on 31
       July 2024

   In our [143]Policy Statement, we said we want firms to make full use of
   the implementation period to embed the Duty effectively. We also said
   we would support firms’ work by feeding back useful insights on what we
   see in the market. We set out our expectation that by the end of
   October 2022, firms’ boards (or equivalent management body) should have
   agreed their plans for implementing the Duty and be able to evidence
   they have scrutinised and challenged their plans to ensure they are
   deliverable and robust enough to meet the new standards.

   We have reviewed the implementation plans of larger ‘fixed’ firms,
   which have a dedicated supervision team at the FCA, where we believe
   they are substantially in scope of the Duty. We did this to better
   understand firms’ approach to embedding the Duty within their
   businesses. As well as engaging with individual firms directly, we are
   publishing findings from this review to help all firms understand our
   expectations and implement the Duty more effectively.

2. Who this applies to

   The findings from this review are likely to interest:
     * regulated firms preparing for the Consumer Duty to come into force

     * industry groups/trade bodies
     * industry experts and commentators

3. What we did

3.1. The firms in our review

   After the end of October 2022 milestone, we requested the Consumer Duty
   implementation plans from larger fixed firms with a dedicated FCA
   supervision team, who primarily operate in retail financial services
   markets. These are the firms with the greatest potential impact on
   consumers and markets.

   Whilst our findings are primarily drawn from our reading of these
   plans, in some cases our views are supplemented by what we have learned
   from discussing the plans with firms or by asking questions during the
   course of our regular supervisory engagement.

3.2. What we sought to establish

   We reviewed these implementation plans to better understand firms’
   approach to embedding the Duty within their businesses. We considered a
   range of different factors, including:
     * Firms’ approach to governance and arrangements for ongoing
       oversight of their implementation work.
     * The deliverability of firms’ plans, and their ability to meet the
       implementation deadline.
     * Assessing firms’ understanding of, and engagement with, third party
       providers where firms are dependent on third parties to implement
       their plans.
     * How far plans address the substantive requirements of the Duty as
       set out in our final rules and guidance. This includes the four
       outcome areas involving products and services, price and value,
       consumer understanding and consumer support.
     * Firms’ data strategies to ensure they will be able to identify,
       monitor, evidence and stand behind the outcomes their customers
       experience.
     * Firms’ culture and people strategies to ensure their business will
       be focused on delivering good outcomes for consumers and that all
       staff understand their responsibilities under the Duty.

4. What we found

4.1. Summary of findings and implications for firms

   We welcome all firms’ efforts to respond to the Consumer Duty and make
   the changes needed to meet the new standards within the implementation
   period. This review adds to our understanding of the progress that the
   industry is making as a whole.

   Many of the plans we reviewed showed that firms have understood and
   embraced the shift to focus on consumer outcomes, established extensive
   programmes of work to embed the Duty, and are engaging with the
   substantive requirements, including the four outcome areas. We are
   convinced this will bring benefits for both consumers and firms.

   However, we did also identify plans that suggested some firms may be
   further behind in their thinking and planning for the Duty. This brings
   a risk that they may not be ready in time, or they may struggle to
   embed the Duty effectively throughout their business.

   We know that the plans we reviewed can only give us a snapshot of
   firms’ planning at one point of time. Many firms will have work in
   place that was not reflected in these high-level plans or will have
   progressed their work further since then. However, this review gives us
   an important overview of progress in large firms, and a benchmark for
   our ongoing engagement with those firms as we work to ensure they embed
   the Duty effectively.

   Through our review we have identified many examples of good practice,
   and also examples where firms may need to improve their implementation
   approach. We think all firms will find these examples useful, as they
   will help them better understand our expectations and recalibrate and
   improve their embedding work where necessary.

   Our review has highlighted three key areas where firms should
   particularly focus their attention during the second half of the
   implementation period (to 31 July 2023):
     * Effective prioritisation: We saw some plans where it was not clear
       what the basis was for prioritising some implementation work ahead
       of other aspects. Firms should make sure they are prioritising
       appropriately, focusing on reducing the risk of poor consumer
       outcomes and assessing where they are likely to be furthest away
       from the requirements of the Duty.
     * Embedding the substantive requirements: We recognise plans were
       likely to be high level given the early stage at which we reviewed
       them. Nevertheless, we saw some plans that suggested firms may have
       considered the requirements superficially or are over-confident
       that their existing policies and processes will be adequate. We
       urge firms to carefully consider the substantive requirements of
       the Duty, as set out in our final rules and guidance. Firms should
       ensure that, when they are reviewing their products and services,
       communications and customer journeys, they identify and make the
       changes needed to meet the new standards.
     * Working with other firms: To implement the Duty on time, many firms
       need to work and share information with other firms in the
       distribution chain. However, we found some plans which gave little
       focus to this area. This suggests some firms may need to accelerate
       their work on this important aspect of implementation.

   As they oversee the implementation of the Duty, firms’ boards and
   management bodies will want to particularly focus and provide challenge
   in the three areas above, as well as the wider points in the ‘key
   findings’ section below.

5. Next steps

   As set out above, firms should consider the findings from our review,
   and develop their implementation plans and approach in line with good
   practice where appropriate.

   We will continue our work to support firms’ embedding activities in the
   run-up to the July 2023 implementation deadline for new and existing
   products and services:
     * We will continue to engage with fixed firms where we have questions
       about their plans or approach, and to monitor the progress they are
       making in embedding the Duty. We will also be working with and
       supporting board champions at some larger firms.
     * We will soon be sending a survey to a sample of firms to help us
       understand the progress they are making in implementing the Duty
       and will carry out targeted engagement with smaller firms.
     * We will shortly be issuing letters to firms, highlighting our key
       expectations on implementing the Duty and some of the key risks and
       consumer harms we are concerned about in their sectors.
     * Our programme of communications on the Duty will continue, for
       example, with further updates to our dedicated [144]webpages and a
       series of [145]regional in-person events for specific groups of
       small and medium-sized firms.

6. Key findings

   We set out further detail on our findings below. Where we reference
   good practice on this page, these are positive examples we have found
   from our review work. Under the heading ‘areas for improvement’, we
   cite practices and examples we identified in our review where firms may
   need to develop their approach further to ensure they meet expectations
   under the Duty when it comes into force. Our supervisors are also
   providing feedback to individual firms, where appropriate.

6.1. Governance and oversight

   Under the Duty, we will be holding firms – including their senior
   managers and boards – accountable for delivering good outcomes for
   consumers. We want to see senior leaders in firms driving the changes
   needed to meet the Duty standard.

   We have set an expectation that firms appoint a Consumer Duty champion
   at board or equivalent level. This is not a ‘prescribed responsibility’
   under the Senior Managers &amp; Certification Regime (SM&amp;CR). Instead, this
   champion role is to support the Chair and CEO in raising the Duty in
   all relevant discussions and to challenge the firm’s management on how
   it is embedding the Duty and focusing on consumer outcomes. Our rules
   also make clear that we expect customer outcomes to be a key focus for
   important areas, such as risk and internal audit functions.

   Chapter 10 of our [146]Finalised Guidance gives more information on our
   expectations in this area.

Good practice

     * Many firms have developed robust governance frameworks for their
       implementation work, with clear executive accountability for
       delivery and board oversight.
     * We identified evidence that plans had been scrutinised and
       challenged by firms’ boards, executives and their audit and risk
       functions. For example, through questioning resource requirements
       and interaction with other ongoing project work. In one example, a
       firm is delivering one-to-one deep dive sessions with board members
       on plan deliverables.
     * Most firms have appointed a Consumer Duty board champion at an
       appropriate level to ensure that the Duty is discussed in a
       meaningful way. We identified an example where a firm with a large
       group structure has appointed two champions to reflect the
       diversity of its different regulated entities.
     * Many plans detailed clear arrangements for ongoing scrutiny of
       their firm’s implementation work by the board, executive and their
       audit and risk functions. For example, by making the Duty a
       standing agenda item at key governance forums and through plans for
       independent reviews of implementation work by risk and compliance
       or internal audit functions.
     * We also saw evidence of firms involving risk and compliance and
       internal audit teams in a timely way. This included:
          + frank assessments by these teams of current risks to
            successful and timely delivery
          + assurance of the effectiveness of controls in place over Duty
            implementation
          + planned assurance work before the deadline on implementation,
            with immediate and further assurance work planned after the
            deadline
     * Some firms have established central coordinating forums to drive
       consistency in interpreting the Duty across different business
       functions, or for coordinating required changes to systems and
       technology across workstreams.

Areas for improvement

     * We identified plans that gave little detail on who is leading the
       overall implementation programme and is responsible for it, or who
       is leading the various workstreams within the programme.
     * In some cases, there was more limited evidence that firms’ boards
       and committees had properly scrutinised and challenged plans. In
       one example, there was no evidence of engagement with the firm’s
       Chair or other non-executive directors, and the board only asked
       one question before approving the plan. In another example, board
       minutes showed that the plan was approved without discussion.
     * Some plans gave no timings, even tentatively, for when progress
       updates on the implementation programme would be provided to key
       governance bodies, including the board.
     * Some firms have been slow to appoint a Consumer Duty board
       champion. In one example, a champion was proposed who did not
       appear sufficiently senior to provide confidence they would be able
       to effectively challenge the firm’s approach to implementing the
       Duty.
     * A small number of firms did not propose an individual champion or
       champions but suggested that the role be shared across the entire
       board or executive. While we have not been prescriptive on the
       champion role, as we want firms to implement this in a way that is
       effective for their business, this is not what we intended and our
       view is this will not be an effective approach given the extent it
       is likely to dilute the role.
     * Some firms did not include a summary opinion from risk and
       compliance or internal audit teams on their implementation plan and
       its risks or chances of meeting the deadline.
     * Some plans suggested firms need to further develop their approach
       on how they will engage with the board and executive
       post-implementation to provide ongoing assurance that they are
       meeting expectations under the Duty.

6.2. Culture and people

   The higher standards of the Duty and the shift to focusing on consumer
   outcomes will require a significant change in many firms’ culture.

   Firms should ensure that the interests of their customers are central
   to their culture and purpose and that this is embedded throughout the
   organisation. This means strategies, leadership and people policies
   (including incentives at all levels) lead to good outcomes for
   customers. Individual accountability and high standards of personal
   conduct in firms will ensure that firms are meeting their obligations
   under the Duty.

   Chapter 10 of our [147]Finalised Guidance gives more information on our
   expectations in this area.

Good practice

     * Some plans set out a clear people and training approach to ensure
       all staff understand their responsibilities under the Duty.
       Different approaches were proposed to engage staff, including
       all-staff and role-tailored training, internal communications
       campaigns and awareness-raising through company town hall meetings.
       One firm noted that it had delivered interactive training on the
       Duty to its board.
     * One firm set out plans to explain its purpose and values in a way
       aligned with delivering good consumer outcomes, updating internal
       cultural and training materials to reflect this as appropriate.
       Another firm detailed how it will embed the Duty in its strategy,
       governance structure and decision making.
     * Some plans confirmed firms will review reward and incentive
       structures and performance management frameworks at all levels to
       ensure they reflect the Duty. One firm noted it plans to
       incorporate the Duty within the design of its staff performance
       scorecard. Others explained that their SMCR regime will be updated
       to include the Duty, with senior leaders expected to lead the
       cultural change needed.

Areas for improvement

     * Other plans were lacking in detail in this area, with limited
       information about how the Duty will be embedded in firms’ culture
       and people approach.
     * In some cases, plans recognised the importance of a culture focused
       on delivering good customer outcomes but provided little
       explanation of tangible action the firm needs to take to ensure
       this is the case. These plans gave no evidence of any consideration
       of how far their firm’s current purpose, culture and values do, or
       do not, align with the Duty, or how improvements in those would be
       made.

6.3. Deliverability

   Embedding the Duty is a complex task. We recognised this in extending
   and phasing the implementation period. So, it is essential that firms
   continue to develop and monitor robust implementation plans to make the
   changes needed to meet our expectations when the Duty comes into
   force.

   We expect firms to have carried out analysis for all relevant areas of
   their business to scope the work required, set out clear workstreams
   and milestones with appropriate resource and documented key risks,
   mitigation strategies and dependences.

Good practice

     * Most firms have effectively set out key workstreams, with some
       clearly mapping the milestones they need to meet to have a
       realistic prospect of meeting the implementation deadline. In one
       example, a firm had allocated specific workstreams based on the
       structure of the Duty and its requirements as set out in our final
       rules and guidance. Each workstream included a clear breakdown of
       deliverables, milestones, and target completion dates with a
       framework for tracking progress.
     * It was typical to see firms break down their implementation
       programmes into workstreams aimed directly at the Duty’s four
       outcomes and closely related considerations like vulnerability.
       Other workstreams were aimed at key ‘enablers’ such as policies and
       standards, consumer journeys and processes, data and monitoring,
       and cultural embedding and training.
     * Some plans gave a clear account of how the implementation programme
       and its workstreams range across, and are being taken forward in,
       different parts of the business, or entities within the firm or
       group structure.
     * Some firms have clearly committed resource that matches the scale
       of uplift and challenges presented by implementing the Duty. We
       noted examples where firms have identified early, and in detail,
       any resource shortfalls for timely implementation – especially in
       areas like technology – and have a commitment and plan to address
       this. Some firms are investing sensibly in support and advice from
       external experts where this assists and adds value.
     * Some firms had considered how their Consumer Duty implementation
       work aligns with other ongoing change initiatives or strategic
       programmes. They considered alignment and differences, as well as
       highlighting any dependencies and bottlenecks of timing or
       resource.
     * Many firms had set out key delivery risks. The most effective
       examples of this provided an adequate explanation of the risk,
       proposed mitigation strategies, assigned owners and confirmed plans
       to track these in relevant governance forums and committees.
     * Some firms set out a sensible approach to prioritise or triage
       implementation work. This approach was based on an initial
       assessment of where they believe they have most work to do to meet
       the Duty standard and there is greatest potential for poor consumer
       outcomes. For example, we saw plans that recognised where certain
       parts of the business may be starting from further back in their
       journey towards implementing the Duty. Others identified and ranked
       in a reasoned and consistent way the products or services, customer
       journeys and communications which present higher risk of harm under
       the Duty. They then prioritised these for detailed review or gap
       analysis against the Duty outcomes.
     * We found evidence of firms seeking to pragmatically meet the
       challenge of timely implementation by taking more agile or flexible
       approaches. For example, by progressing workstreams in parallel
       rather than sequentially, or by pressing ahead with partial fixes
       on a ‘no regrets’ basis, where potential improvements have been
       identified, even if the whole picture is still unclear. Some firms
       have a clear view of what may require tactical fixes by the
       deadline and what may need fuller strategic solutions
       subsequently.

Areas for improvement

     * Some firms’ implementation work appears to be less progressed than
       others with gap analyses at an earlier stage and project
       requirements yet to be fully scoped. We identified examples where
       timelines seemed unclear, or sequencing confused. Some did not give
       any indication of the number or proportion of products, services,
       communications and customer journeys covered by their work plan, or
       of their respective assessment of risks or priorities.
     * Some firms’ approach to prioritising implementation work seemed
       less clearly based on an assessment of the potential for poor
       consumer outcomes. In one example, a firm said it intended to focus
       on ‘signature actions’ but it was unclear what these were or how
       they were decided. Another plan noted that the firm would only be
       able to address material findings by the deadline but gave no
       account of what it would regard or define as material in that
       context.
     * In some cases, risks and internal and external dependencies were
       not clearly set out, with apparently little thought given to
       mitigation strategies. Some firms may need to give further
       consideration to their resource planning, as they provided limited
       information in this area. In one example, a firm noted resource is
       stretched but did not provide clear ways of managing this. In
       another example, most implementation work appeared to be allocated
       to staff on top of their existing roles with limited dedicated
       resource. Other plans noted a shortfall in budget or technology
       resource but without setting out plans for addressing this.

6.4. Third parties

   The Duty applies to all firms with a key role in delivering retail
   customer outcomes, including those with no direct customer
   relationship. It will be essential for firms to work together across
   distribution chains to deliver good outcomes for the end retail
   customer.

   Firms should therefore be considering where and how they work with
   third parties to deliver products and services to customers, and make
   sure these arrangements will meet expectations under the Duty. This
   includes other firms in the distribution chain and where firms
   outsource the delivery of services to other parties. In particular,
   manufacturers and distributors will need to work together and share
   information. To help ensure this happens, we have set a milestone for
   the end of April 2023 for manufacturers to complete all reviews
   necessary to meet the four outcome rules and share information with
   distributors to allow them to meet their obligations.

   Chapter 2 of our [148]Finalised Guidance explains how the Duty applies
   across the distribution chain. Chapter 6 gives examples of the type of
   information we would expect to be shared between firms, where
   appropriate.

Good practice

     * Some firms appeared to have a good understanding of implementation
       dependencies with third party providers and had allocated time in
       their plan for this work. We identified one example where a firm
       had set a cross-outcome objective to work with partners in a
       transparent way to ensure cooperation and that Duty requirements
       are met. Other examples included:
          + a firm working with a key supplier on a framework for
            engagement on the Duty
          + detail of a firm’s extensive engagement with a critical
            supplier to shape its plan
          + face-to-face workshops arranged by one firm with its third
            party agents to design their approach
          + a firm that included a workstream to assess relevant contracts
            and plans so they could embed change requirements into
            renegotiations at the earliest opportunity

Areas for improvement

     * Other firms’ work appeared less developed in this area. Some
       recognised that they do work with third parties – and that they
       would need to consider this – but did not specifically identify key
       third party relationships or the nature of any dependency. In some
       cases, it was also unclear what, if any, engagement had taken place
       or was planned with relevant third parties. Some firms showed
       limited consideration in their plan timetable of the need to engage
       and, where appropriate, exchange information with third parties in
       a timely way.


6.5. The four outcomes

   We expect the Consumer Duty to improve outcomes for consumers in all
   areas of business between firms and customers. The Duty’s four outcomes
   cover the key elements of the firm-consumer relationship.

   The Duty means consumers should get communications they can understand,
   products and services that meet their needs and offer fair value, and
   they get the customer support they need, when they need it.

   Firms should carefully consider the substantive requirements set out in
   our final rules and guidance (including Chapters 4 to 9 of our
   [149]Finalised Guidance), identify where they fall short, and make the
   changes necessary to their products, communications, systems and
   processes to meet the Duty standard.

Good practice

   Some plans were clearer than others that firms had engaged with the
   substantive requirements of the Duty and considered what these mean for
   their businesses and the changes they will likely need to make. The
   most effective plans in this area attempted to define good customer
   outcomes in the context of their business and considered how to deliver
   these through improvements to their products and services,
   communications and the support they provide. Firms set out plans to
   build on and uplift existing frameworks around product governance,
   product value assessments and the clarity of communications as
   appropriate. For example:

Products &amp; Services

     * Some firms had clearly identified the number of open and closed
       products that they hold and carried out an initial exercise to
       prioritise for review those with greatest risk of causing consumer
       harm. For example, one firm identified several specific products in
       its range that present a risk of poor outcomes to a certain group
       of customers and has prioritised these, with a clear path for
       making the required improvements.
     * Some firms had identified where they will need to build on existing
       product governance and assessment frameworks to meet the new
       requirements under the Duty. For example, one firm acknowledged
       that it needs to collect greater granularity of information to
       ensure the design and management of its products and services is
       aligned to the needs, objectives and characteristics of customers
       in the target market. Another firm explained it is developing a
       product level management dashboard with metrics to monitor the
       performance of its products.

Price &amp; Value

     * It was clear that some firms are considering what fair value means
       in the context of their business models, products, services and
       customers. For example, one firm noted that a full value chain
       analysis is in progress, and it has identified areas where value
       can be improved. A different firm explained it is giving particular
       focus to making sure there are no hidden or unexpected costs for
       customers.
     * Several firms explained they are considering how their current
       approach needs to change to deliver good outcomes for consumers.
       For example, one firm noted it has a fair value framework, but this
       needs to evolve to better consider non-price factors and ensure
       there is a reasonable relationship between costs and benefits to
       meet Duty requirements. Another firm noted that it has new pricing
       models under development. Similarly, one firm recognised that its
       product pricing structure may need to change to address an issue it
       has identified in relation to high fees.
     * We identified plans where clearer consideration is being given to
       whether products and services offer fair value to different groups
       of customers, including those with characteristics of vulnerability
       or with protected characteristics.

Consumer Understanding

     * Some plans showed firms are carefully considering how to give
       customers the information they need, at the right time, and
       presented in a way they can understand to make effective decisions.
       In one example, a firm explained that it is developing new
       communication standards, including consideration of reading age,
       comprehensibility, visual accessibility and layout. Some plans
       specified actions firms are taking, including ensuring product
       terms and conditions are explained in simple language and available
       in other languages, and websites clearly set out cancellation
       rights and how to make a complaint.
     * It was clearer in some plans that firms are considering their
       different communications channels. For example, one firm noted it
       is making improvements to its call centre scripts to better support
       customers with the information it provides. Another firm noted its
       intention to review the consistency of information provided to
       customers by its distributors.
     * Some firms noted they are developing greater communications testing
       capability to support good customer outcomes. For example, one firm
       set out plans to carry out testing of communications pre-release,
       post-release and on existing content. Another firm explained it has
       developed a range of options for suitable testing depending on
       different risk factors. Similarly, one firm recognised that
       differences in the complexity of products means that a more
       tailored approach could be appropriate in some areas.
     * A number of plans detailed metrics firms will use to measure
       consumer understanding. For example, one firm noted it will
       incorporate marketing data and customer behaviour into its ongoing
       monitoring activity. Other firms cited different metrics they plan
       to capture going forward, including the percentage of customer
       facing content being tested and the percentage of customers who
       take the expected action after communication.

Consumer Support

     * Some plans more clearly set out the customer outcomes they want
       their support processes to deliver, with firms making commitments
       including to ensure call waiting times are not unreasonably long
       and the quality of support provided is monitored.
     * Some firms identified specific customer journeys that need to be
       improved to better support customers in vulnerable circumstances,
       including new mechanisms for customers to notify the firm of any
       additional needs or vulnerability. For example, one firm explained
       it is giving particular focus to bereavement, fraud and complaints
       processes.
     * It was clear that some firms are considering their support channel
       approach. For example, one firm set out plans to provide
       information to customers via their channel of choice and in ways
       that better support good decision-making. Another firm noted it is
       planning new and expanded support channels for its customers.
     * Some firms explained they are considering steps in their support
       processes and whether these help or hinder the delivery of good
       customer outcomes. For example, one firm explained that work has
       started to review customer journeys and improvements have already
       been made impacting several of its product lines. The firm has
       prioritised remaining journeys using a risk-based approach, with
       further improvements planned where any barriers to good customer
       outcomes are identified.
     * Several firms cited different metrics they will collect to monitor
       they are delivering the support their customers need, including
       call waiting times, resolution times, first contact resolution
       rates, call transfer accuracy metrics and quality and complaints
       themes.

Areas for improvement

     * Given the high-level nature of many plans at time of review, there
       was more limited evidence in some plans of how firms have engaged
       with the substantive requirements of the Duty. For example, plans
       included high-level actions such as ‘review customer-focused
       policies and procedures to ensure they capture and reference the
       requirements of the Duty’ and ‘assess whether existing products
       deliver fair value’. This type of task-based description gave no
       indication of how firms have interpreted the Duty’s requirements
       and considered the challenges of how they will apply them to their
       businesses, or the consumer outcomes they are aiming to deliver.
     * Other plans seemed rather complacent about past improvements,
       initiatives or current frameworks, and their adequacy for meeting
       the Duty or for putting the firm in a good position to do so.
     * In several cases, it was unclear exactly what methodology or
       approach the firm will use in its reviews or gap analyses of
       products, services, communications and customer journeys against
       the Duty outcomes. Similarly, it was unclear how some firms will
       amend and uplift existing assessment frameworks to meet the Duty
       standard. If firms are behind in their thinking about how exactly
       to conduct these reviews and gap exercises effectively, they risk
       being behind in their planning of how long such exercises will
       likely take.


6.6. Data strategies

   A key part of the Duty is that firms assess, test, understand and
   evidence the outcomes their customers are receiving. Without this, it
   will be impossible for firms to know that they are meeting the
   requirements set out in the Consumer Duty.

   The type of information firms will use will vary depending on factors
   like size, client base and the types of products and services they
   offer.

    Firms will need to use their judgement to identify data sources as
   evidence against the outcomes of the Duty. Chapter 11 of
   our [150]Finalised Guidance gives examples of the types of data firms
   could collect.

Good practice

     * Firms that had considered the consumer outcomes they are aiming to
       deliver also tended to have considered the data they need to
       measure and monitor the delivery of these outcomes.
     * Some firms had clearly carried out exploratory work to understand
       the data and metrics available across their businesses and set out
       plans to bring these together, as well as any remaining gaps in
       their Consumer Duty data requirements.
     * Some firms set out longer-term strategic aims to advance the
       functionality of their systems and data collection, but also
       shorter-term solutions to evidence and monitor that Duty
       requirements are being met and customers are receiving good
       outcomes.

Areas for improvement

     * Not all plans clearly explained the data required to monitor
       compliance with the Duty. Some plans offered more limited detail of
       firms’ in-depth consideration of their data requirements under the
       Duty and how they will source, package, monitor, govern, and act
       upon these.
     * In some cases, firms’ data strategies seemed to be largely based on
       repackaging existing data, with limited consideration of gaps or
       the outcomes it is intended to monitor. If firms assume they can
       ‘get by’ largely with repackaging or supplementing existing data,
       then they risk not thinking deeply or afresh about the types and
       granularity of data that they will actually need to monitor and
       evidence outcomes under the Duty effectively.
     * In some plans there appeared to be more limited consideration of
       how firms will monitor outcomes for different groups of customers,
       including those in vulnerable circumstances.

Overview

   The temporary increase to the nil rate band for Stamp Duty Land Tax
   (SDLT), which is the rate before you start paying SDLT on residential
   property has been extended.

   Rather than ending on 31 March 2021, the temporary nil rate band of
   £500,000 will be in place until 30 June 2021. Then from 1 July 2021 to
   30 September 2021 the nil rate band will be £250,000. The nil rate band
   will return to the standard amount of £125,000 on 1 October 2021.

   The rate of SDLT which applies to your purchase depends on the date
   that you [45]complete your property purchase and not the date that you
   exchanged contracts.

Residential Rates on purchases from 8 July 2020 to 30 June 2021

   If you purchase a residential property between 8 July 2020 to 30 June
   2021, you only start to pay SDLT on the amount that you pay for the
   property above £500,000. These rates apply whether you are buying your
   first home or have owned property before.

   You can use the table to work out the SDLT due:
            Property or lease premium or transfer value          SDLT rate
   Up to £500,000                                                Zero
   The next £425,000 (the portion from £500,001 to £925,000)     5%
   The next £575,000 (the portion from £925,001 to £1.5 million) 10%
   The remaining amount (the portion above £1.5 million)         12%

   From 8 July 2020 to 30 June 2021 the special rules for first time
   buyers are replaced by the reduced rates set out above.

   Use the [46]SDLT calculator to work out how much tax you’ll pay.

Residential Rates on purchases from 1 July 2021 to 30 September 2021

   If you purchase a residential property between 1 July 2021 to 30
   September 2021, you only start to pay SDLT on the amount that you pay
   for the property above £250,000.

   You can use the table to work out the SDLT due.
            Property or lease premium or transfer value          SDLT rate
   Up to £250,000                                                zero
   The next £675,000 (the portion from £250,001 to £925,000)     5%
   The next £575,000 (the portion from £925,001 to £1.5 million) 10%
   The remaining amount (the portion above £1.5 million)         12%

   From 1 July 2021 the special rules and rates for first time buyers
   apply, including first time buyers purchasing property through a shared
   ownership scheme.

   Use the [47]SDLT calculator to work out how much tax you’ll pay.

Higher rates for additional properties

   The 3% higher rate for purchases of additional dwellings applies on top
   of temporary reduced rates above for the period 8 July 2020 to 30 June
   2021 and also for the period 1 July 2021 to 30 September.

   The following rates apply:

Higher Rates from 8 July 2020 to 30 June 2021

            Property or lease premium or transfer value          SDLT rate
   Up to £500,000                                                3%
   The next £425,000 (the portion from £500,001 to £925,000)     8%
   The next £575,000 (the portion from £925,001 to £1.5 million) 13%
   The remaining amount (the portion above £1.5 million)         15%

Higher Rates from 1 July 2021 to 30 September 2021

            Property or lease premium or transfer value          SDLT rate
   Up to £250,000                                                3%
   The next £675,000 (the portion from £250,001 to £925,000)     8%
   The next £575,000 (the portion from £925,001 to £1.5 million) 13%
   The remaining amount (the portion above £1.5 million)         15%

   From 1 October 2021 the higher rates will then apply on top of the
   standard rates of SDLT.

   Use the SDLT [48]calculator to work out how much tax you’ll pay.

New leasehold sales and transfers

   The nil rate band which applies to the ‘net present value’ of any rents
   payable for residential property is also increased to £500,000 from 8
   July 2020 until 30 June 2021. From 1 July 2021 to 30 September 2021 the
   nil rate band will then be decreased to £250,000.

   The following rates will apply:

From 8 July 2020 to 30 June 2021

   Net Present Value of any Rent SDLT rate
   Up to £500,000                Zero
   Over £500,000                 1%

From 1 July 2021 to 30 September 2021

   Net Present Value of any Rent SDLT rate
   Up to £250,000                Zero
   Over £250,000                 1%

   Companies as well as individuals buying residential property below the
   nil rate band thresholds shown in the above tables will also benefit
   from these changes, as will companies that buy residential property of
   any value where they meet the relief conditions from the corporate 15%
   SDLT charge.

   On the 1 October 2021 the temporary rates of SDLT will revert back to
   the standard rates that were in place prior to 8 July 2020.

Autumn Statement 2023: No Green Stamp Duty Rebate

   Dr Jing Du responds to the lack of Green Stamp Duty Rebate in the 2023
   Autumn Statement.
   Published 23 November 2023•1 min
   Hand holding a plant.

   The Green Stamp Duty rebate is aimed at encouraging UK homeowners to
   install energy-efficient measures like heat pumps. The UK government
   has not officially adopted this proposal, as it was not included in the
   Autumn Statement 2023. This indicates a different set of priorities in
   the government's environmental policy approach, focusing perhaps on
   other aspects of carbon reduction and energy efficiency rather than
   individual homeowner incentives.

   The exclusion of the Green Stamp Duty rebate from the UK's Autumn
   Statement 2023 reveals several profound implications:
    1. Prioritization of Immediate Fiscal Challenges: This omission
       highlights the government's prioritization of immediate economic
       issues over long-term environmental strategies. It suggests a focus
       on more urgent fiscal matters such as addressing the immediate cost
       of living crisis and supporting vital public services.
    2. Impact on Homeowners' Decisions: The absence of the rebate may
       deter homeowners from investing in green improvements. Financial
       incentives like the stamp duty rebate are crucial in motivating
       homeowners to undertake costly renovations for energy efficiency.
       Without such incentives, homeowners may find the cost of green
       renovations prohibitive, leading to a delay or complete avoidance
       of these essential upgrades.
    3. Long-term Economic and Environmental Consequences: The decision may
       have significant long-term implications. Investing in energy
       efficiency is crucial for reducing carbon emissions and enhancing
       economic resilience by decreasing energy costs and reliance on
       non-renewable energy sources. The fact that the rebate is not
       included in the statement could mean missed opportunities in
       fostering a more sustainable, energy-efficient economy and could
       hinder progress towards broader environmental and economic goals.

     * [2]Tobacco
     * [3]Hydrocarbon Oil
     * [4]Methyl Alcohol

Quantities of Alcoholic Liquor and Tobacco for Incoming Passengers (effective
from 1 August 2010)

   A passenger aged 18 or above is allowed to bring into Hong Kong, for
   his own use, 1 litre of alcoholic liquor with an alcoholic strength
   above 30% by volume measured at a temperature of 20℃ exempted from
   duty.

   If the passenger holds a Hong Kong Identity Card, he must have spent 24
   hours or longer outside Hong Kong.

Disabled people must work from home to do ‘their duty’, says UK minister

   People with mobility and mental health problems should work from home
   or lose benefits under new policy
     * [109]UK politics live – latest updates

   People with mobility and mental health problems will be asked to work
   from home or lose benefits as part of what a UK government minister
   described today as doing “their duty”.

   The policy will be set out on Wednesday as part of the autumn statement
   amid a drive by [112]Rishi Sunak to make changes to the welfare system,
   which he described on Monday as “unsustainable”.

   Hundreds of thousands of people will be told to look for work that they
   can do from home or face having their benefits cut by £4,680 a year,
   under plans that were first reported by the Times.

   Laura Trott, chief secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: “Of course
   there should be support for people to help them into work but
   ultimately there is a duty on citizens if they are able to go out to
   work they should. Those who can work and contribute should contribute.”

   Earlier, she told Times Radio the government’s plans were “not just
   about forcing people out”. She added: “It’s saying we’re going to put
   the right mechanisms around you to help you with that. But ultimately,
   you have to engage with that, and that is an obligation on you as a
   citizen to do this. And if you don’t do this, we will look at
   sanctions.”

   There was strong criticism from charities. Ayla Ozmen, the director of
   policy and campaigns at the anti-poverty charity Z2K, described the
   plans as “rushed and ill-thought-out”.

   “There is no evidence to support the idea that there are fully remote
   jobs available that are suitable for these groups,” she said.

   “This is simply a cut for those of us who become seriously ill or
   disabled in the future and need the support of social security, and
   risks worsening people’s health and pushing them further from work.”

   Sarah White, the head of policy at the national disability charity
   Sense, said: “Everyone should be able to work if they want to and can,
   but this latest government move looks sets to punish disabled people,
   adding more anxiety on to disabled households that are already
   struggling.”

   Details of the policy will be set out by the Department for Work and
   Pensions (DWP) after consultations by the government some months ago
   about work capability assessment (WCA).

   Trott also went further than Sunak or [119]Jeremy Hunt when asked if
   the autumn statement would go beyond business tax cuts. Asked if the
   chancellor would be cutting taxes for individuals, she told the BBC’s
   Today programme: “That is where the focus is.”

   “In broad narrative terms this is a big moment for us, for people at
   home, because inflation has halved. We know how difficult it has been
   and it will mean important things for the household budget.”

   [124]The UK government is about to make some disabled benefits
   claimants even poorer | Lucy Webster
   Read more

   Charities have already warned that DWP plans to tighten health-related
   benefits – which are provided to more than 3 million working-age adults
   in the UK – could cause “huge anxiety” and mean “sanctions” for
   disabled people.

   Campaigners have also said that welfare changes could lead to many
   losing out on almost £400 a month in support. Tony Wilson, the director
   of the Institute for Employment Studies, told the Guardian in September
   that extra support to help disabled people into work should not come
   with such stringent conditions.

   Speaking on Monday in London about the plans to make changes to
   benefits, the prime minister said : “We believe in the inherent dignity
   of a good job. And we believe that work, not welfare, is the best route
   out of poverty.”

   “Yet right now, around 2 million people of working age are not working
   at all. That is a national scandal and an enormous waste of human
   potential. So, we must do more to support those who can work to do so.

   The number of people on health-related benefits has risen by a quarter
   since the eve of the Covid pandemic. Most of these are in the limited
   capability for work-related activity (LCWRA) group, who receive the
   additional £390.06 a month.

   Chandigarh: An officer of the Superintendent of Police (SP) rank in
   Punjab has been suspended for alleged dereliction of duty in connection
   with the security breach during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to
   the state in January last year.

   The officer, Gurbinder Singh, was at the time of the incident posted as
   the Superintendent of Police (Operations) and was on duty in Ferozepur.

   Singh, currently posted as an SP in Bathinda district, has been
   suspended with immediate effect, according to an order issued by the
   Punjab Home Department on Wednesday.

   On January 5, 2022, Prime Minister Modi's convoy was stranded on a
   flyover due to a blockade by protesters in Ferozepur after which he
   returned from Punjab without attending any of the events, including a
   rally. The security breach ahead of the Punjab Assembly elections had
   led to a major political controversy.

   According to the suspension order, a report dated October 18, 2023 on
   the incident was submitted by the Director General of Police (DGP) in
   which the state police chief said that Singh did not perform his duty
   properly.

   After consideration of the matter at the level of the competent
   authority, the officer concerned is suspended with immediate effect,
   said the order issued in Punjabi.

   A Supreme Court-appointed committee that probed the security breach had
   earlier indicted several state officers for lapses.

   The top court had on January 12 last year appointed the committee to
   probe the breach, saying these questions cannot be left to 'one-sided
   inquiries' as they needed 'judicially trained independent minds' to
   investigate.

   Last updated on November 23, 2019 by [14]Surbhi S

   [15]duty vs responsibility Duty and Responsibility are wider terms,
   which are used in a number of contexts, say in the field of law,
   management, education, ethics and so forth. These are commonly used
   with one another, but they are two different terms, wherein the duty is
   imposed on someone, to perform something which is morally, legally or
   professionally considered right. It is something which we are required
   to do as per law, conventions, rules and norms.
   [INS: :INS]

   On the other hand, the responsibility is undertaken, i.e. something
   which a person has to take care of or handle. When a person is
   responsible for something, he/she becomes the one to be held
   accountable for or blamed for its performance and completion or
   non-completion. In this article we are going to talk about the

Definition of Duty

   Duty can be defined as a moral, legal, or professional obligation which
   a person is bound to do, otherwise, he/she has to face certain
   punishment or penalty. It determines what a person should have done in
   the normal course of action in general or in specific circumstances.

   The law governing the country has specified certain duties which must
   be followed by every citizen. It exhibits an invisible force which
   binds a person to do something which is considered right in the eyes of
   law, whose non-performance may result in fine or punishment.

   Duty is the obligatory task, conduct, work or service, that emerge out
   of an individual’s position, occupation or role.

   In management, the word ‘duty’ is used to define the tasks or functions
   which an employee has to perform, as it is a part of his/her job.

   In economics, duty is described as a form of tax levied by the
   government on the goods purchased from or sold to foreign countries.
   The non-payment of such taxes may result in a penalty to the exporter
   or importer.

Definition of Responsibility

   Responsibility refers to a state of having some authority or obligation
   to undertake a task satisfactorily which has been assigned by someone
   who is superior or elder, so as to attain the desired results. It is
   required to be undertaken as a part of a job or role.

   It makes a person answerable or accountable for the completion of the
   task, or safekeeping of valuables/cash, or protection of a person.
   Hence, the person who accepts the responsibility has to be ready to
   bear the consequences, for his/her actions or decisions taken in this
   regard, which may be positive or negative.

   Responsibility often comes with the authority to give directions and
   take relevant actions when required. When authority is delegated to a
   person, he/she becomes responsible for its performance and the optimum
   use of the delegated authority.

   It reflects the trust of the person delegating the authority on the
   person to whom it is delegated, that the task will be completed
   accordingly.

Key Differences Between Duty and Responsibility

   The points given below are substantial so far as the difference between
   duty and responsibility is concerned:
    1. Duty refers to the legal or moral obligation, or commitment towards
       certain work, which you are expected to perform, in general, or
       special circumstances. On the contrary, responsibility refers to
       the liability that requires fulfilment which is either assumed,
       voluntarily accepted or promised, by an individual, inherent to
       his/her job or role.
    2. Duties show a hidden binding force that impels a person to do a
       certain act, which is regarded as the right thing to do in a
       particular situation. As against, responsibility brings authority,
       i.e. the power to take necessary decisions and actions and give
       proper directions for the successful completion.
    3. Duties exhibits respect, sincerity, of the person towards the work
       (task), elders and superiors and obedience. Conversely,
       Responsibility gives birth to accountability, i.e. acceptance of
       certain responsibility by a person makes him/her accountable for
       its performance.
    4. Duty requires the sacrifice of self-interest by the person to whom
       it is ascribed. In contrast, responsibility demands trustworthiness
       and loyalty, i.e. the person to whom the responsibility of a
       certain task is given must be trustworthy and loyal to perform the
       tasks as required.
    5. Duties are imputed on a person, either naturally or out of the
       role/position he occupies. On the other hand, responsibility is
       nothing but demanded duties, which are shouldered on a person who
       is competent and conscientious enough to handle it.

Conclusion

   Duty brings responsibility, i.e. when you say it is your duty, it
   indicates that you ought to do that because you are responsible for
   that act if it is not done properly, within the reasonable time. It
   requires allegiance on the part of the concerned individual, for the
   discharge of duties and responsibilities successfully.
